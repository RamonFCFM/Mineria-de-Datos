21475,Spain,"Dark and rubbery on the nose, but also lightly leafy and herbal, with oak and coffee for cover up. The palate is good but slightly rough and narrow, and the flavors are not as deep and developed as they have been in the past.

21703,Spain,"Mildy green tobacco aromas lead the way along with forest floor, fern notes and standard berry aromas.

25050,Spain,"Floral fruit aromas suggest blueberry, but overall this vintage lacks the power and depth that Termes and its big brothers are known for. Airing sets up sweet, easygoing berry flavors and full tannins, but in the middle it's less whole than it has been in other years.

25175,Spain,"Opens with a load of sweet, candied black-fruit aromas but this wine excels on the nose because it's composed and precise for being so young and simple in scope.

Drink from 2011 through 2015.",Numanthia,91,60.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia
123930,Spain,"Floral fruit aromas suggest blueberry, but overall this vintage lacks the power and depth that Termes and its big brothers are known for. Airing sets up sweet, easygoing berry flavors and full tannins, but in the middle it's less whole than it has been in other years. A juicy, well-made wine that should not be judged as weak just because 2007 was a marginal vintage. Drink now through 2013.",Termes,89,30.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia
124475,Spain,"Opens with a load of sweet, candied black-fruit aromas but this wine excels on the nose because it's composed and precise for being so young and simple in scope. Velvety, rich black-cherry flavors run the show, and the finish brings length and an herbal shading. Very nice for a wine from Toro at this price.",Dama de Toro,88,11.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fariña
124569,Spain,"Warm, earthy aromas of molasses, moss and baked fruit scream rich and big, and the palate matches that early announcement with cola, baked blackberry, coffee and syrupy flavors. Weighty and forceful, but not without style and a flash of elegance. Pure Toro; drink now through 2012.",Prestigio,91,27.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Cyan
126060,Spain,"Definitely a once-ripe, raisiny wine with hard Toro tannins and molasses aromas and flavors. Borderline syrupy but with enough structure and grip to make the grade. Warming and rich wine, with a fierce strucutre and big tannic framework. Drink now.",12 Meses,88,19.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Cyan
126963,Spain,"Maturing fairly well, with brown edges to the wine's earthy hue. The nose is rooty and deep, but there's a definite cheesy, mildly bretty accent to it. And the mouthfeel is defined by major tannic grip and bite. Warm and mildly raisiny, with caramel on the finish. Drink now.",Pago de la Calera,87,55.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Cyan
127442,Spain,"The quality of the 2009 vintage is reflected in this value-priced Toro that's full and medicinal but also balanced and rewarding. Flavors of medicinal red-berry fruit are mixed with thicker, chocolaty notes, while the finish is bold, grabby and solid. A blend of Tempranillo and Garnacha.",,86,8.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Caño
127891,Spain,"We would not have expected anything to match the stellar 2004 San Román, but this newest vintage is up to the task. It's opaque as midnight without a moon, and the nose is a delectable blend of vanilla, spice, hickory, mocha and meaty blackberry. The palate is both magnetic and sly; it pumps black fruit galore, but augments things with controlled chocolate and spice. Finishes a mile long, with cream, intensity and guile. This wine does not mess around. Best from 2010–2016.",San Román,95,67.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Maurodos
128041,Spain,"Heavy, dark, candied and jammy, with a hint of licorice to the nose. The palate is chunky and concentrated, with meaty berry flavors and a dose of chocolate. Short on the finish, yet fruity if a bit flat.",Spada,85,13.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Bodegas Fariña
128211,Spain,"Excelencia is a great wine that offers a lot of character beyond just bold fruit and body. This is by far the best El Albar that the Lurtons have made; it features citrus peel, sexy berry fruit and baking spices on the nose, and then sweet berry, black plum, spice and warmth on the palate. It's powerful as a Toro wine should be, but not tannic or harsh. A monster with a smile; drink now and over the next 5–8 years.",El Albar Excelencia,93,42.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,J. & F. Lurton
128633,Spain,"Lively, candied and medicinal, with grassy aromas along with mild animal notes.

A basic young wine that's decent if you're not too discerning.",Viñas de Olivara,84,9.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Marqués de Olivara
129660,Spain,"Meaty, cuddly and kind is the best way to describe this big-boned, ultra ripe Toro. What makes it great is the price ($20 is a steal for this) and the complete lack of fierceness. It's easygoing but complex, with pulsing blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors. With modest but measurable tannins, it should age nicely for at least five years and maybe more, making it a bargain hunter's dream.",El Albar Barricas,91,20.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,J. & F. Lurton
130761,Spain,"Termanthia is the pinnacle of Tinta de Toro. Aromas of wild blackberry, crude oil, forest floor and truffles are just now showing themselves, while the tight, tannic palate is full of black plum, blackberry and bitter chocolate flavors. Espresso and roast meat notes grace the dark, jam-packed finish, and as a whole this is one bold, boisterous wine. Best in 2011 thru 2013. Only 531 cases.",Termanthia,95,200.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia
130831,Spain,"A top-flight Toro that knows how to step on the gas but keep the car centered. Aromas of dried lavender, violets, coffee and black fruit come together marvelously, while the palate is dark as Mud Cake but still loaded with tasty blackberry and black currants. Pure and strapping, and giving all the oomph that Toro is known for.",Élite,93,38.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Muruve
130838,Spain,"The Lui & William bodega is behind this outstanding Tempranillo from Toro. The wine shows a brilliant violet tint in front of intense, inky aromas of black cherry and chocolate cake. The palate is superripe and bucks like a bronco; the tannins are dense and form titanic structure, and the finish of coffee and spice hints at a fine cigar. It's a huge load at 15%, so be prepared.",Lui Selection,93,27.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Abelis Carthago
131096,Spain,"Dense and dark, with huge black-fruit aromas, toasty oak, chocolate and balsamic notes. Numanthia is ripe, rugged and intense, with in-your-face black fruit, coffee and burnt-toast accents. The feel and finish are deep as a cool well, and smooth as a whistle. Masculine to the max, and pretty close to being ready to drink. Best to hold until the fall or winter. 12,000 cases made.",Numanthia,93,60.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia
131185,Spain,"Make room in the cellar for this heavyweight! Talk about a monster wine; but there's also finesse, character and style to it. Alabaster is the top wine from the Eguren family's new Toro winery, and it's big, tannic and loaded with spice, molasses and syrupy black fruit flavors. Rich, long and fierce on the finish, with tannins and heat to resolve. Best from 2012 through 2020.",Alabaster,94,250.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
131362,Spain,"Dark, rubbery and focused on the nose, while the palate is wider, richer and propped up by a band of zesty acidity.

A finish of brandied berries, kirsch and chocolate is almost like dessert.",Termes,92,30.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Numanthia
131487,Spain,"This is the tier-two wine from the Egurens' new Toro project, and it's stellar. Intense aromas of black fruit, char and mint start it out, and next up come cola, roasted black fruit, clove and cured-meat flavors. Oak is forward now, but it should settle in a year or so. A dynamite Toro to drink from 2011 through 2018.",Victorino,93,71.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
131500,Spain,"Starts with roasted, leathery aromas that feature hints of burnt beef and berry compote. The palate is layered and nicely balanced, with berry flavors hitting first and chocolate coming next. Espresso is the final act, as it ties the mouth to the finish in impressive fashion. A big load but one that's still manageable.",Tinto Roble,90,20.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Rejadorada
131749,Spain,"Toro is not usually a prime hunting ground for Best Buys, but this full-throttle wine is solid, gritty and tastes and smells nice.

131776,Spain,"Teso la Monja is the new Toro winery from the Eguren family of Rioja fame (former owners of Numanthia-Termes in Toro), and it's proof that no beat has been missed since they sold out to Moët Hennessy. Expect dark, intense black fruit aromas and flavors mixed with heat, tannin, cola and spice. Some oak creeps out on the finish, but overall this is a lovely, bullish Toro. Drink now through 2014.",Almirez,92,22.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
131923,Spain,"The nose is all dense blackberries, while the palate is deep, flashy and ripe, with flavors of black cherry and blackberry. If you like big, bold wines, then this one should strike you in a good way; it's saturated and dark, with a touch of vanilla and mocha on the finish. Great balance for such a big wine. Drink now through 2012.",Élite,91,36.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Muruve
131991,Spain,"These are the kinds of Best Buys we love. In the case of Muruve's '04 crianza, the wine overdelivers by a sum and a half. The nose brims with cola, tar, menthol and other dark aromas, while the big but balanced palate delivers a belt of blackberry and plum flavors along with chewy, ripe tannins. Good now with grilled meat, but will age for another five years should you want to invest in more than one bottle.",Crianza,91,15.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Muruve
132059,Spain,"Tough, earthy berry aromas provide a fierce outlook. The palate answers the call, showing syrupy richness amid piercing tannins.

Could it use a bit more balance perhaps?",Gago,88,34.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Red Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
132147,Spain,"A touch heavy, but not nearly as weighty and syrupy as this winery's '03 Excelencia. At 14%, it's a bit raisiny and blustery, but the dark plum and coffee flavors do manage to please. And the finish is full of chocolate and fudge-like residue. Big but fun; ready to be drunk now.",El Albar,88,20.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,J. & F. Lurton
132308,Spain,"Ultraripe, almost to the point of being syrupy and soupy. The nose is all sweet licorice, baked fruit and raisin.

133032,Spain,"Generally speaking, this wine is nicely balanced and a bit less over the top than most 2003s. The nose shows mint, fresh herbs, graphite and berry aromas.

133170,Spain,"The wines of Abelis Carthago are enigmatic. The lowest-priced Lui is the most balanced and complete. This wine, William, is dark and dense, with shoe polish and raw crude oil on the nose. It's super strapping and tannic, with bitter chocolate and coffee notes carrying the racy palate to a fiery finish. It lacks nuance and subtlety but will augment a good steak with nary a problem.",William Selection,90,34.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Abelis Carthago
133199,Spain,"Ripe, jammy and forward, Prima could become the blueprint for affordable but well-made Toro wines. It's a modern bruiser from a modern, spotless facility, and it offers a clash of wild berry flavors, big-time tannins and powerful acidity. Like most Toro wines, it'll take your cheeks to the cleaners if you don't have meaty foods, cheese or lots of water to go with it. Drink now through 2012.",Prima,90,18.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Maurodos
133741,Spain,"You wouldn't call this wine “clean and polished.” It has some old country brett along with fig, earth, mushroom and liqueur on the nose. That said, it's dishing up heavy servings of chocolate and baked berry pie flavors. A big, bulky wine that's already losing clarity. This won't be for everyone.",Monte Toro Roble,89,17.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Bodegas Ramon Ramos
134044,Spain,"Muruve is a label worth watching in Toro. The wines are not as brawny and robust as some, and instead they offer more reserved pleasures.

134081,Spain,"Raisiny and sweeet smelling, with baked qualities but also a bitter bite of horseradish.

134281,Spain,"The aromas are powerful and just the slightest bit brambly. A little hot and rugged on the palate, but loaded with prime black fruit, pepper and mocha notes.

134349,Spain,"Crushed floral aromas, berry-infused tea and cherry candy aromas give this wine a sweet profile. The palate, however, is anything but.

134357,Spain,"Abelis Carthago's top wine, Fighting Bulls, is also its toughest to enjoy. There's overripeness and barnyard on the nose, and thus the prune, black plum and jammy berry flavors that control the palate are not surprising. Big and forceful for sure, but also choppy and incongruent across the palate.",Fighting Bulls,88,60.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Abelis Carthago
134672,Spain,"A good taste of Toro at the right price. The nose deals classic baked fruit, rubber and girth, while the warm, full palate shows reasonable vitality along with berry and cassis flavors. Solid and a little chocolaty on the finish. A textbook warm-climate Spanish wine.",Auroch,86,12.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Tribal
134714,Spain,"Smells a touch green and pasty, and while the wine is deep and dark, there isn't a whole lot of definition or specificity to it. Sweet and heavy in the mouth, with chocolate notes.

135304,Spain,"Seems like the brutal heat of 2003 got to this wine in a negative way. The result is a thick, unctuous, syrupy wine with a ton of sweetness but not much balance.

135609,Spain,"Jammy and full of raisin, stewed berries and leather. Calling it ultraripe might be an understatement because it's nearly over the top in its heft, extract and tannin level.

136172,Spain,"Opens with black cherry, baked plum and other heavy, semiroasted aromas.
