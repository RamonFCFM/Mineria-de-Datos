White flower lychee and apple aromas carry the mellow bouquet. The chunky-feeling palate bears powdery sweet flavors of peach and melon mixed with greener notes of grass and lime. The 80% Viognier component is typical of the warm climate: plump and oily with a short finish. Chardonnay fills out the blend.,Chile,Viognier-Chardonnay
A berry aroma comes with cola and herb notes. The palate is tangy and racy and it delivers raspberry and plum flavors with a modest finish.,Chile,Merlot
This is much different than Casa Silva's 2009 Petit Verdot which was tasted in the same flight. The '08 is more hard spicy and tarry with a leafy herbal aroma plus some grittiness. The palate feels snappy with a can't-miss saltiness. The finish is long in length but short on fruit with a raw feel.,Chile,Petit Verdot
Lightly herbal strawberry and raspberry aromas are authentic and fresh. On the palate this is light and juicy with snappy lean flavors of red fruit and dry spice. The finish is dry and oaky.,Chile,Pinot Noir

A bright nose with green apple and citric aromas comes with mild oak. This is acidic and racy in composition with roundness along the edges of the palate. Apple and nectarine flavors are lightly oaked and salty while this holds form on a high-acid finish.,Chile,Chardonnay
This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon Syrah and Merlot opens with blackened aromas of charred oak and creosote but it quickly sheds that oak-heavy character to display toasty flavors of olives herbs and berry fruits. All together this is a classic Chilean red blend with fine tannins and patented lightly herbal balsamic flavors. Drink through 2020.,Chile,Red Blend
Dry briary aromas of field brush black olive herbs berry fruits and saucy tomato are textbook Maipo. This is fresh a touch choppy and not overly heavy. Flavors of cassis plum and vanilla carry over to the finish which is fresh and bolstered by fine natural acidity. Drink through 2022.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Dry spicy aromas of tobacco cedar vanilla and berry fruits come together nicely. This Maule Valley Cab is fresh and harmonious across the palate with nothing too pushy. Complex balsamic flavors of olives herbs dried berries turned earth and cocoa finish dry peppery and elegant. Drink through 2019.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Haven't seen this unusual combination of grapes in quite some time and you know what it's much better now than when we last saw it in 2001. This vintage has a nice almost magnetic nose while the palate is firm and well structured with cassis black cherry coffee and licorice flavors. It's a bit boring on the finish but the mouthfeel and length are just fine. Fruity rich and balanced. 325 cases made.,Chile,Red Blend
Composed and structured with its fair share of richness manifested as raisin and molasses. Interestingly the palate rings with acidity resulting in a feel that's borderline sharp. But there's enough fruit and heft to balance things out and the flavors of cherry blackberry and cola are nice. A good example of elevated Carmenère (with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon) that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.,Chile,Carmenère
Bisquertt usually does well with its value-priced Merlots and seeing that 2007 was an excellent vintage in Chile this wine excels in the value price range. The nose is dark and saturated but pure and inviting. And the palate is ripe and smooth with spice plum blackberry and herb notes particularly anise. Finishes clean smooth and peppery. Drink now.,Chile,Merlot
Clean and honest up front with moderate richness and modest telltale Casablanca pineapple aromas. The plate is creamier than many wines in this price range with flavors of apple cider citrus and some pith. Overall this is a good value wine with enough citrus and acidity to qualify it as fresh.,Chile,Chardonnay
Rooty and leafy on the nose with red berry aromas peeking through some obvious oak. The palate offers cherry and raspberry flavors along with sweetness and things are backed by vanilla and chocolate. Good tasty and oaky with proper layering.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Foresty and dark on the bouquet with aromas of licorice prune forest and foxiness. The palate is full and tannic while flavors run sweet creamy and slightly syrupy with chocolate and spiced fig notes. Finishes rich and rough with dry herbs and true Chilean Cab flavors of olive and oregano.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Fiery and wild at first with aromas of cinnamon pepper and Juicy Fruit gum. Strange as that may sound the wine finds a more familiar place on the palate where plum cherry and cassis flavors are flashy and the feel is a bit clangy. Rounds out with air and settles down fairly nicely.,Chile,Merlot
Mildly minty and woody on the nose with grass wintergreen and cheese aromas as well as red fruit. The palate is tight and grabby with a blast of citric acid that gives the plum and raspberry flavors a tart decidedly “red” personality. Snappy and crisp on the finish making it a fresh lean style of Cabernet.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Opening aromas of vanilla cookie show a resemblance to Animal Crackers while the palate is more vivacious and tangy with flavors of orange tangerine and apple. We wouldn't call this an elegant or refined wine but we like its no-issues attitude and citrusy content. Probably good with salads and seafood.,Chile,Chardonnay
Frosted aromas of orange creamsicle lychee and melon give this an elevated unique sort of bouquet. Among Chilean Gewürztraminers this is one of the more expressive ones you'll find. Pineapple mango and other tropical flavors are pleasant while the feel is forward and fun. Drink this summer with fish and salads.,Chile,Gewürztraminer
Gritty heavily roasted aromas of peanuts and herbal berry fruits lead to a scratchy tannic palate. This tastes of burnt oak raw plum and currant while the finish tastes briny and harsh. The 2012 version of this wine was much better. This is rough from front to back.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Jumpy on the nose at first but then green tea and grassy aromas take over. This PN is what it is: it tastes grassy leafy and like green beans. Vegetal notes carry over to the finish.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Aromas of pumpkin squash and corn chips are stale and not inviting. There's an acceptable mouthfeel to this weird unbalanced Chardonnay along with flavors of spiced squash mealy apple and sautéed root vegetables.,Chile,Chardonnay
Aromas of mint berry syrup and dense lemony oak lay a good foundation for the heavy black fruit that comes on the palate atop a plush carpet of toasty fresh-grained wood. The finish is round tasty and mouthfilling while overall the wine seems to dance due to popping acidity. This is Carmenère with a vital streak.,Chile,Carmenère
At first this is aggressive with an aromatic note of wet dog along with blueberries. But soon it finds its legs and opens to display chocolate espresso and a big batch of black plum and blackberry. The finish has full tannins and some coffee-like flavor. Currently it's wall-to-wall big but it should settle down in no time and become a good red to drink on any occasion.,Chile,Merlot
With its herbal traditional aromas this New World Cabernet could impersonate and Old World model. The palate is tight and firm with lively tannins and bracing acids. The flavors run toward plum and chocolate and there's a bitter hint on the back palate. The finish is plummy and dark.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Right off the bat this wine is pure and smooth. The nose is pretty with cranberry and cassis. Next up is a palate of pure red fruit and only a light shading of oak. The finish draws applause for its clarity and buttery nuances. It's what a good Chilean Cabernet should be; it's ripe and easy to drink yet fairly solid and impressive. Best Buy.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
With full oak and pineapple aromas along with a big mouthful of spicy apple and pear fruit this is no weakling. On the contrary it's full and meaty with a lot of texture and extract. The feel is healthy even if the acidity is on the low side. A very good wine to drink now; it probably won't age that well.,Chile,Chardonnay
Strongly oaked but fresh young and healthy in the nose. The smell of coconut and lemon curd is friendly and soft while the palate is loaded with more lemon coconut pear and nutmeg. The texture is rich and for now the acidity is bright. A solid Chardonnay for current drinking.,Chile,Chardonnay
Smooth smelling with pure and fresh berry and plum aromas. Very young and a bit tangy on the palate with cherry and berry flavors and an oaky soft finish that goes sweet then sour and lasts for a long time. In terms of structure it's balanced mildly tannic yet meant for drinking now.,Chile,Merlot
Fresh aromas of red cherry and light berry fruit precede a palate that runs a little racy with borderline tart plum and pie cherry flavors. A solid mouthfeel and mild chalky tannins give it presence and for sure it's a clean sturdy wine. But that's really as far as it goes.,Chile,Pinot Noir
On the plump but balanced side with a perfumed nose that's almost sweet for SB. In the mouth it's fairly lively and lifted with nectarine and melon flavors that morph into pink grapefruit on the finish. Decent quality; will get the job done.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Formerly doing business as “Shiraz” this Syrah from Bisquertt offers a huge purple tint roasted aromas of blackberry and campfire and a ripe grapey palate that brims with simple racy black cherry pepper and other driving flavors. Not timid by any means but also nothing out of the ordinary.,Chile,Syrah
Aromas of baked apple nut oil and toast are mildly appealing while the round dry palate is home to flavors of melon and bitter pith. The finish of peach pit and citrus peel is par for the course and overall it's time to get at this standard Chardonnay before it goes flaccid.,Chile,Chardonnay
Baked blueberry and boysenberry aromas are more ripe than delicate. This Merlot is saturated and deeply tannic. Flavors of coffee chocolate and lemon peel precede a toasty finish that overflows with chocolaty oak and lingering tannins. Drink through 2023.,Chile,Merlot
Jammy berry aromas seem reduced at first with notes of iodine and rubber. But with airing this packed Syrah comes around. A flush saturated tannic palate is home to toasty blackened berry coffee and spice flavors. On the finish burnt toast and espresso flavors don't slip. Drink through 2022.,Chile,Syrah

Good introductory Carmenère. It's a touch green which is common for this quality level but there's also some coconut and mild burnt aromas to wade through. Lively and clanky on the palate with red fruit bramble and herbal snap. Good if you're not expecting too much.,Chile,Carmenère
Denser and less herbal than the 2005 Gran Reserva with fresh cassis and plum fruit to go with some chocolaty overtones. This has plenty of intensity and structure.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon

Lavender and licorice on the nose; the palate mixes shy black cherry and cassis flavors with a bit of Chile's patented leafy character. The finish is round and offers a touch of vanilla and mocha. For the money this is solid and very easy to drink.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
A good but awkward attempt at a bigger more saturated more serious wine. The nose tells you that it's ripe but there's some reduction in there too. The palate is revved up and tannic with turbulence along the way. Spice chocolate and heat all play a part on the berry-driven palate.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère
There's no shortage of heavily charred oak and early on it may seem a bit mulchy and leathery.

Clacky tannins make food almost mandatory.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon

The oak on this wine gives it a strong resin and cinnamon character. Along the way there's floral berry aromas cherry and plum flavors and finishing notes of root beer chocolate and cough drops. A bit woody and tannic but it gets the job done.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon

Heavy and gold in color with aromas of browned butter wheat and corn cakes. The bouquet and color are heavy and so is the palate: There you get oak barrel and toast but little to no fruit. Even the finish is woody with just a hint of melon and banana. A good experimental wine for those eager to taste oak; otherwise steer clear.,Chile,Chardonnay

Prickly punchy pryazinic aromas will have you thinking this is Sauvignon Blanc or Spanish Verdejo. A sharp palate is more about acid than body while this continues with its SB-like character via green flavors of lime and arugula. A crisp finish evaporates into nothing.,Chile,Chardonnay
Heavy oak and marginal white-fruit scents make for a compromised nose. This feels chunky and resiny with heavy flavors of clove and raw wood. Additional clove notes on the finish render this Chardonnay an underachiever.,Chile,Chardonnay

Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company LLC.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Hickory and other resiny aromas dominate the nose and oak is the major player from start to finish. If you like a thick Chardonnay weighted down with cinnamon resin and extract then this is it.

Hints of melon and talcum powder suggest sweetness and the palate is ripe a little soft and dominated by pear and even some lychee flavors. Maybe there's a hint of residual sugar but if so it's minor. Mild bitterness doesn't really help the finish but overall this is a flavorful and competent value wine.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Slightly funky and pickled but also dusty and endowed with raspberry and plum aromas. The palate rests on tangy rhubarb and nectarine while the bouncy mouthfeel has spritz and kick. If not for the pickled rhubarb character it would be more strongly recommended.,Chile,Rosé

Always one of Chile's best values; an overperformer year after year.,Chile,Red Blend
Two samples of this Cabernet were tasted and both are reduced and smell like spray paint. A clampy tannic palate offers stewy black-fruit flavors in front of an overoaked finish. This lacks flow and doesn't seem entirely natural.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Chemicalized aromas of lemon peel and turpentine are offputting. This feels bland and tastes oxidized and bitter.,Chile,Chardonnay
Sweet and oaky and a little bit forced but even so this is a natural full-bodied Chardonnay with a chunky palate and tropical sweet flavors.

Dark and heavy from the beginning with thick berry smoked meat olive and earthy aromas. Concentrated and stout in the mouth with blackberry blueberry and chocolate flavors mixed with herbs and big tannins. Sweet berry and mocha flavors control the finish.,Chile,Syrah

One of Chile's best Malbecs. This vintage is very rich and compact with blackberry marzipan and cola aromas. The palate is firm and sturdy but more like a bench than a plush chair. Superripe and a little clumsy with really intense cassis and cherry flavors. Fruity almost to the point of being over the top.,Chile,Malbec
The Grand Reserve blend which is 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and lesser parts Carmenère and Petit Verdot is clearly Simone's best wine.

Toast coconut and pineapple all work the bouquet. It's zesty and healthy on the palate with pear coconut and baked apple flavors.

The bouquet smells like spiked fruit cocktail and in the long run what's wrong with that? The palate is open and fairly easy with a touch of kick pushing citrus tropical fruit and even some mineral notes. A more citrusy and fresh style of Viognier with 15% Chardonnay.,Chile,White Blend
Among Chilean Chardonnays this one gets it more right than wrong. The nose deals apple pie and mineral while the palate shows mostly apple pear and butterscotch flavors. Not complex or stately but round fresh and generally on target.,Chile,Chardonnay
There's no escaping the asparagus and canned bean aromas that consume the bouquet but those scents do fade after a while and the nose eventually leads to flavors of lime white peach and citrus.

Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company LLC.,Chile,Syrah
Perfectly good for the price with a dark smoky outlook and masculine aromas of mocha roasted berry and violet.

Minty creamy and as oaky as can be. Coconut sawdust carob and other barrel-based aromas steal the nose with secondary black fruit and thick tannins composing the palate.

But the fruit is of unquestionable high quality and if you give it time to air out you'll get the best results.,Chile,Syrah

Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company LLC.,Chile,Chardonnay

Clos Apalta continues to push the envelope for Chilean icon wines. It's always been a blend of four or five Bordeaux grapes and the 2005 is every bit as structured tight and ripe as any predecessor. There is an intense blanket of new oak that tastes of mint cinnamon sawdust and black licorice. When that subsides (maybe in another 12 months) expect racy and complex berry flavors pinpoint tannins and preserving acidity. Hold for another two years; then drink through 2014.,Chile,Red Blend

Dark spicy and chocolaty until the last remnants of the finish conclude; this needs lots of air to show its best.,Chile,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
This Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère blend is a green machine with a pyrazine-led explosion of green bean and bell pepper aromas.

Bold and red on the nose with only mild herbal aromas. That slight herbal character extends to the palate where red plum and red currant flavors take over. With adequate size and plenty of fuel in the tank this is no wallflower of a wine. But it is a bit limited and tangy and the acidity seems amplified.,Chile,Carmenère
This blend of Cab Sauvignon Merlot Cab Franc and Petit Verdot is heavily oaked to say the least. Early on you must battle through a blanket of woody aromas to get to strawberry and vanilla flavors. Airing gives the wine a milder personality but a dialing back of the oak treatment wouldn't hurt. Imported by Pelco Inc.,Chile,Cabernet Blend

Quite the floral wine with blueberry and violet aromas that distinguish it from others. But the palate is sharp and choppy with high acidity that lends sharpness to the black cherry and raspberry flavors. Stirs interest because it breaks the mold of heavy black fruit-dominated Syrahs. But it's also strange and not fully in gear. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company LLC.,Chile,Syrah
Dusty apple pear and other dry-fruit aromas give this clean wine a good but basic starting point. The palate is fresh but exceedingly simple in terms of its apple kiwi and nectarine flavors. Pithy and bitter on the finish but fresh. Tastes and smells like a standard white Rioja.,Chile,Pedro Ximénez

Fruit for this Bordeaux blend (it's only 80% Cab) is grown organically in Maipo Valley's San Bernardo Vineyard.

It's a little tight now and will be better in a year or two.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Very nice Cabernet with a competent mix of earth black fruit olive and toast on the nose. The palate is firm warm and spicy with good balance and classy flavors of rich berry and chocolate. Lush just sweet enough balanced and long on the back end. Drink now through 2012.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Kingston's top-level Pinot Noir has been a consistent scorer for the past three vintages.

The bouquet is wheaty and honeyed but not all that fresh. On the palate the wine feels chunky and full with a nutty flavor of honeyed stone fruit. Melon honey and hazelnut flavors carry the finish.,Chile,Gewürztraminer

Put this away until 2015 then drink through 2024.,Chile,Red Blend

A slight sharp wine with hints of vinegar and bramble on the nose and then skinny cherry and cranberry flavors. Too much bite and acid and not nearly enough depth richness or fun.,Chile,Red Blend

The palate is soft but not what you'd call flabby while flavors of pear apple and banana are innocuous and shouldn't send anyone running to the door. For best results drinknow.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Can't really say there's much difference between this and Carta Vieja's Classico SB. Both are bland with chunky apple and pear characteristics. Neither has much of a pulse but on the plus side they aren't nasty or aggressive. This “limited release” turns out to be a basic wine for basicoccasions.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Plump but wholly generic with semisweet aromas that are neither here nor there. The palate is round with adequate to good mouthfeel. And the flavors of citrus are solid but kind of pithy and bitter. A full chunky wine with virtues as well as some flaws. Drink right away for best results.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Aromas of grapefuit blend with green vegetal notes of asparagus. The palate is pliant and easy with mango citrus and green bean flavors. Doesn't commit to being green and vegetal or blaring and citric; falls in between.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Approachable and stately. Aromas of toast bacon and reduced berries get it going in the right direction while blueberry and cassis flavors control the palate.

Congratulations to MontGras and chief consultant Paul Hobbs for making a serious Cabernet (with 2% Malbec) that most folks can actually afford.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Slightly sharp and brambly on the nose with muddled fruit aromas. The palate is both lactic and snappy with spiky acidity mixed with buttery creamy notes. Finishes kind of pasty with bite and grab. Even at $10 this Maule Valley Pinot struggles with the pleasure factor.,Chile,Pinot Noir
A reedy and odd-smelling wine. No matter how many times you come back to it there's the scent of latex and a strange perfume to the nose.

Can't say this does much to push Carmenère's status.,Chile,Carmenère
Looking for a juggernaut red that cries out for steak? Give this lush stylish nearly flawless Carmenère a shot and you won't be disappointed.

A winner from a winery that up until now hasn't shown much.,Chile,Carmenère
The Carmenère in this Carm-Cabernet-Syrah blend is the lead singer so expect a touch of minty green and herbal essence. It's a heavyweight in the sense that the mouthfeel is big and the tannins are a little hard. But with airing it unveils classy spicy berry flavors and wood-based accents of vanilla and butter (20 months in new oak will do that). A big wine that needs some airing. Ready now but can rest well in the cellar for a few more years.,Chile,Red Blend
This is a punchy wine that's fresh on the nose. The palate sports a viscous feel that's related to Viognier and Chardonnay while the Sauvignon Blanc and Sauvignon Gris in the blend bring a citrus-like quality and an asparagus flavor.  The finish quickly loses steam.,Chile,White Blend
This is about as racy as Sauvignon Blanc from Chile gets. It's green and melon-like on the nose with punchy asparagus and lime aromas.

A hard spice aroma leads the charge and while the nose is tough and closed it harbors a solid black-fruit element.

Smooth and dark on the nose this exudes a deep earthy accent of lead pencil. The palate is firm tannic and layered with healthy doses of blackberry cassis black pepper and tobacco flavors.

Light elegant and lithe on the nose with a touch of stemminess to the core plum and cherry aromas. Feels just right with a feminine touch and snap to the mouthfeel. Flavors of red plum raspberry herbs tomato and dried spice lead to a fresh focused finish. Top level for under $15.,Chile,Pinot Noir

More oaky and resiny than in prior years with a strong undeniable scent of sawdust. This suggests faux-oak aging via tank staves which results in a textured but resiny wine that lacks fresh fruit. Too much like a tour through the sawmill.,Chile,Chardonnay
Fairly hot and aggressive with salinic green aromas along with peppery fruit and coffee. The palate is kind of sharp and underwhelming with green-infused plum and berry flavors. And the tomato leaf element on the finish leaves you wondering about ripeness. A mix of Carmenère and Cabernet Sauvignon.,Chile,Carmenère-Cabernet Sauvignon
New Zealand seems to be the model for this highly pungent and scrappy wine. To this taster Quintay's basic Casablanca SB is easier to like and more balanced. This one is prickly to the max with sweaty aromas and flavors of lemon-lime tarragon and celery. It's sharp and cleansing but not quite fruity and rewarding enough to rank as an excellent wine. Still it has its virtues.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc

The flavor profile is herbal with stewed plum and blueberry accounting for the fruit components. On the finish this feels solid and tastes minty.,Chile,Carmenère
What a difference a year makes. In the warm '09 vintage this was ripe and delicious. But in 2010 a much cooler year in Chile the wine came out dry and leafy with aromas of green herbs that strengthen with airing. Flavors of mint and green herbs are dominant while plum and spice flavors form the underbelly. A scratchy feeling finish confirms this wine's abrasive DNA.,Chile,Cabernet Franc

Baked berry hard spice and exotic chocolate flavors end toasty and warm but lively and complex. Drink through 2024.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Pungent aromas of lemony oak peanuts and maple are the opening act. The next act is a big sweet palate with monster extraction and the flavors of brandied black cherries. For some it might be too sweet especially when the acidity kicks in to create a juicy palate feel not unlike fruit juice.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Pungent with grapefruit and grassy aromas that are true to the variety. The palate is fresh the flavors good and fruity. There's mango and tangerine and also some garden-fresh asparagus in the mix. The finish too is perfectly fresh; it's there one moment and gone the next.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
A no-frills mass-appeal wine with a pretty color ripe aromatics and a hint of oak. The palate is solid and full-flavored while the finish is smooth and easy. Ripe clean and round.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
There is some green bean and ashtray aromas on the nose but also some maple-like wood. The palate is also slightly green at its center but surrounding that is a fair amount of plum and cranberry. The finish is smooth properly textured and tannic enough to create a dry cheek-gripping feel. There's definitely some character here.,Chile,Carmenère
The nose is all black fruit and some cinnamon spice. Next up is a palate of cassis plum and cherry while the finish is round and buttery. Taken as a whole the wine is fairly focused with an easygoing character and nothing too out of whack.,Chile,Merlot
The cherry and cinnamon aromas are true and inviting and they stand up to the oak that's been thrown at this Pinot. The flavor profile deals raspberry and cherry amid oaky shadings. The finish is toasty and warm with some coffee popping up late in the game. Fresh fruity and true.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Compact and full in the nose with a fine level of berry fruit and some attractive wood spice. The mouth offers sweet berry flavors and some toasty oak while the finish is round and soft. There's little complexity or style—what you smell and taste at first is what you get.,Chile,Malbec
The bouquet is fairly exotic as it kicks up some cinnamon and forest floor. But there's also some lemony oak that doesn't really fit in. The flavors of cherry and cassis are tasty but they carry an acidic tang and that aggressive acidity continues all the way through to the back end thus leaving a sharp impression on the palate.,Chile,Merlot
Herbal and spicy with some rubbery notes to the nose and a bit of pickle to the flavors. The plum fruit on the palate is round and peppery while the wine finishes warm and full. Decent fruit but not rich.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
The nose has some pine-based cleaner aromas to it but not much luscious fruit. The palate has apple pear and melon flavors but they are more vague than distinct. The finish is a continuation of what you get on the palate but at the end you get a hint of toffee or caramel. Straightforward and basic; not nuanced or exotic.,Chile,Chardonnay
Aromatically this coastal SB from a cold wet year is caught between citric and vegetal. On the palate this feels tangy but that's about it. Salty green-leaning citrus flavors finish strong although that's not necessarily a ringing compliment.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Generic plum and berry aromas are compact. On the palate this is tight and blocky in feel like a brick of cement. Raspberry and plum flavors are limited and dense while this tastes of mild oak on a slightly hot and fiery finish.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Herbal berry aromas are slightly green and leafy with spicy oak notes. A lively palate is medium-bodied and balanced. Flavors of plum tomato herbs and spice are common for Carmenère while a crisp solid finish is a proper conclusion.,Chile,Carmenère
Punchy mildly herbaceous aromas of olive herbs tobacco and plum are classic Chilean scents. This cool-vintage Malbec is lively and a bit raw on the palate. Savory roasted oaky flavors of minty blackberry and plum finish dry hot peppery and ultimately a touch salty.,Chile,Malbec
Melon and pear aromas lean in the direction of tropical. This pulsing Chardonnay emphasizes acidity and zest over oak and weight. A flavor profile built on tart green fruits and scallion is racy and ends with snap.,Chile,Chardonnay
Chono is one of the better Chilean rosé wines we've come across. It has that Mediterranean look smell and flare to it. The color is attractive the nose fresh and clean and the flavors of orange and fine herbs are crisp and on the spot. Good for this summer.,Chile,Syrah
Sweet basic cherry aromas are candied at first and then darker with airing. The palate is bold juicy a little aggressive and herbal with ample berry and plum fruit at the base. Oaky and long on the finish with a peppery herbal ending.,Chile,Carmenère
Toasty and relatively smooth with a comfortable nose and body. Smoothness is this wine's prime attribute while the flavors are your basic apple and citrus. Finishes with tang and zest and overall the wine satisfies while not pressing too hard to do so.,Chile,Chardonnay
Slightly hard burnt and earthy at first with dark fruit sitting below that cap. The palate is tannic thus the mouthfeel clamps down and closes up like a clam. More generous and savory in terms of flavors with roasted black fruit and aged cheese notes. Narrow and grapey on the finish but legit.,Chile,Syrah
This heavily charred blend of five grapes opens with maple toast wood and floral black-fruit aromas. The palate is full and forward but also alert and juicy. Flavors of blueberry blackberry licorice chocolate and vanilla finish oaky with a final dose of barrel-driven vanilla matching full black fruit. Drink through 2020.,Chile,Red Blend
Saucy spicy aromas of wild berry baked plum and raw oak are forceful and hard-driving. Wide round chewy and resiny in feel this tastes lightly toasted buttery and woody but patience reveals deep berry fruit flavors and spice notes. A barrel-heavy finish indicates that this may benefit from another year or two of aging; drink through 2019.,Chile,Carmenère
A perennial favorite due to its precise yet prickly nose of green melon passion fruit grapefruit and minerality. It's smooth yet cutting on the palate with pithy lime orange passion fruit and lemon flavors. More refined than CDB's Gran Reserva but generally speaking it's a similar wine.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Dense in color with earthy crusty aromas of baked berry moss tobacco cola and cassis. Feels lush meaty and deep with tobacco balsamic flavors baked blackberry and chocolate. Mellow lightly herbal and smooth on the finish; hits all the high marks. Drink now.,Chile,Carmenère

Fresh bell pepper and passion fruit aromas are a bit underripe in character. The palate feels juicy and bright with zesty acidity. Nectarine and green-herb flavors hint at vegetal undertones while the finish is short but fresh. Drink now.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
This opens with a strong sense of oak and sawdust later giving way to herbal berry aromas. This feels plump and resiny with slick oak. Flavors of wood resin and pepper are on equal footing with berry flavors while the finish shows moderate residual heat.,Chile,Merlot
Aromas of saline solution and sawdust accent generic citrus and apple aromas. On the palate this is fresh and citrusy. A blast of sharp lemon apple and quince flavors come before a lightweight but oaky finish.,Chile,Chardonnay
Leafy herbal aromas of plum and raspberry show a touch of tomato with a dash of oregano. This is soft on the palate without a lot of spine or structure. Earthy herbal flavors of stewed berries tomato and green herbs finish minty and leafy but with good feel.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
This basic Cabernet opens with standard berry plum and herbal aromas. It's racy and tight on the tongue with a mix of berry chocolate and minty green flavors. The finish is spicy but not very fruity or complex. This is good as a pizza wine.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
This unoaked Chardonnay starts with aromas of citrus and stalky greens. It's plump in the mouth with soft acids and flavors of pineapple and other tropical fruits. It's just fresh enough but mostly it's innocuous.,Chile,Chardonnay
After initial horsy aromas of saddle earth and roasted berry settle there's oak and a chemical note to the palate which also delivers herbal tart flavors of raspberry and green plum. This is lean and citrusy on the finish.,Chile,Pinot Noir
The aromas on this wine run jammy soft and baked. This is medium in intensity with some dilution and herbal flavors of tobacco berry and spice. The finish is modest and a bit green.,Chile,Merlot
Aromas of pink grapefruit and passion fruit are more in the Sauvignon Blanc field than your typical Chardonnay. Citric and bouncy on the palate this tastes of tart grapefruit orange peel and salt and it stays that way through the finish.,Chile,Chardonnay
Stewed black-fruit aromas are coated with a heavy smear of milk chocolate. In the mouth this feels gooey and sticky. Candied berry flavors are overly chocolaty and finish with coffee and mocha notes.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Dusty cherry and tomato aromas are neither elegant nor elevated. A jagged palate lacks flow while this tastes of salty sour plum. A low-depth finish tastes peppery. Overall this is simply adequate Pinot Noir.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Granular aromas of latex plum and animal lead to a choppy piercing high-acid palate. Dilute flavors of generic berry fruits are candied on one hand and tart and weedy on the other.,Chile,Pinot Noir
If you know Falernia and Elqui then this fits the mold. If you don't you'll probably find this Malbec to be weird or unlikable. Herbal aromas of olive and road tar are common to the winery and region. In the mouth this is heavy syrupy and lacks lift. Blackened stewy berry flavors include notes of cardamom and chocolate. On a flabby finish this tastes of coffee grounds.,Chile,Malbec
Leafy burnt aromas of compost lack freshness. This feels lean raw and grabby while forced flavors of oak and savory roasted plum finish rubbery and tannic.,Chile,Merlot
Aromas of sulfur and swimming pool blow off and leave citrusy notes. Pyrazinic flavors of bell pepper suggest barely ripe (maybe underripe) grapes. That essence is confirmed on a finish via white pepper and bell pepper flavors.,Chile,Rosé
This rusty looking PN smells roasted and stewy with forced oak. In the mouth this is chunky and flat. Stewy oaky plum flavors run sweet and heavy on clove while this reverts to creamy on the finish.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Funky rubbery aromas include a note of compost. This feels grabby with citric acidity. Briny salty slightly vegetal flavors leave you asking “Where's the fruit?”,Chile,Rosé
From the first sniff this crosses the line into the vegetal realm via aromas of canned green beans. A plump round palate is friendly in feel while flavors of salted beans and canned peas finish fully green.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Reduced jammy berry aromas precede a gummy palate. This tastes enriched by sugar and not entirely natural—stewy and candied on the finish. Tasted twice with one sample refermented and spritzy.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Rubbery underripe aromas are neither fresh nor attractive. This shows high acidity and sketchy balance while tart green-leaning red-berry and citrus flavors are bitter and pithy.,Chile,Rosé
Off the bat this smells weedy with a hint of generic red-berry fruit to help things along. A green-tasting wiry palate finishes with burnt underripe berry notes.,Chile,Merlot
Hard gritty aromas suggest underripe raw materials. This feels O.K. but tastes like it smells: gritty and underripe. On the finish it's more of the same but with no wetness to cut the grit.,Chile,Chardonnay
Soapy aromas are oily heavy and slightly tropical. This is a low-acid Moscato with almost no pulse. Sweet flavors taste artificial and there's no lift or pop to the palate. A finish suggestive of bath soap powdered sugar and vanilla holds no sway.,Chile,Moscato
Stalky haystack aromas are yeasty. A chunky palate is shapeless while this tastes of mustard and tart apple. A murky tasting finish turns salty as it fades away.,Chile,Chardonnay
Like most bargain Chilean Cabs the wine is a bit green and herbal with scratchy red-fruit aromas helping it along. The palate has reasonably good depth and saturation with flavors of roasted berry stewed fruits tobacco and green veggies. Good but challenged.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
The low-level “good” rating is more a reflection of the wine's age than its core qualities. It's flat and wayward now with no real direction to the nose or palate. It tastes bland and semisweet with dying acids and simple flavors of apple and melon. Go with the '09 then look for the '10.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Green smelling with lettuce oregano and other herbal aromas. The palate is also green and starchy while the structure screams hard big tannins and fierce acidity. Does not mesh that well; too much green character and hardness to rate better. A blend of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Syrah.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
Brambly red-fruit aromas of currants and pie cherry are on the sharp side while the palate is clacky and tannic with crisp red-plum herb and wayward oak flavors. Finishes full and rugged with toasty heat and an herbal aftertaste. Not a bad wine but it's fairly typical for Chilean Merlot.,Chile,Merlot
Loved the 2008 but at this point in time I can't say the same about this bottling. It's vegetal with heavy bell pepper and asparagus aromas and flavors. Low-volume zest and kick indicates that it has turned; best to wait for the 2010 because this is too green and flat.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Inky grapy aromas come across hard and reduced. This is pinchy and tannic on the palate with dark berry game and crusty flavors. On the finish it's hard-driving with heat and tannic grab.,Chile,Carmenère
There's a lot of oak on this value-priced Chard to the point that any fruit aromas are blanketed. In the mouth there's ample acidity affording good cut while flavors of pear and apple are spiced up by aforementioned forceful oak. Fortunately a resiny tasting finish isn't too heavy,Chile,Chardonnay
After a cheesy opening the bouquet shows tropical fruits but little more. In the mouth this is round and heavy with very ripe flavors of tropical fruits and melon. A big honeyed finish with vanilla and banana flavors is quite sweet.,Chile,Chardonnay
Dark in color with minty oak on the nose this is a medium-to-full resiny wine with cinnamon and clove outmuscling plum and cherry flavors. Resiny oak modest acidity and tertiary fruit flavors work the finish.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Asphalt crusty leather and herbal berry aromas are the opening on this racy Merlot. Flavors run from herbal peppery and olive-driven to red-berry fruits. A spicy finish brings enough red-cherry character to make things work.,Chile,Merlot
A roasted stalky smelling nose is a touch offputting at first but improves with airing. This high-elevation Maipo Pinot is watery on the palate with raspberry plum and earthy spice notes. A modest finish can generously be described as elegant.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Crisp spicy aromas of red fruits matched against oregano basil and olive notes give this Cabernet a lot of character and points of interest. The palate is tight and well structured while dark berry spice herb and chocolate flavors flow onto a toasty minty warm and tannic finish. This is a bit aggressive now; give it two years and drink through 2019.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
This Cabernet delivers a complete package at an incredibly attractive price. Aromas of mocha graphite and vanilla play nicely with core berry scents. Baked berry vanilla and pastry flavors settle softly with mellow tannins. Drink through 2018.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Cool green minerally aromas lead it off and next there's fresh bell pepper jalapeno and gooseberry flavors. Bright focused edgy and stony with proper acidity bite and clarity. A good one similar to the winery's Reserva SB but clearer and more precise.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
This is an earthy somewhat flat wine with herbal berry aromas that fall away in quiet form. A full grabby palate brings berry raisin and tobacco flavors all supported by a modest beam of acidity. A finish of earth tobacco and mulchy flavors announce that 2009 was indeed a hot vintage in Chile.,Chile,Red Blend
This Pinot is aromatic; rhubarb dried raspberry rubber prickly herbal notes and spice scents all vie for attention. This is solid and creamy in feel with cutting acidity and herbal lightly leafy flavors of dried spicy red fruits. A lightly herbal tasting finish is the finale.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Aromas of graphite chocolate olive herbs and berry fruits open this cool-climate Syrah. Laser-beam acidity comes on like gangbusters while those sharp acids create racy almost tart flavors of currant and huckleberry. The finish is more flashy and racy than generous and tasty and thus crispness is the defining character of this wine.,Chile,Syrah
Oveja Negra consistently produces a very good Cabernet with inky darkness and concentrated aromas of black fruits and toast. This vintage is saturated on the tongue with lactic notes as well as acidic cut. Blackberry flavors mix with creamy oak and tangy acidity to create a fresh honest impression.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Herbal plum and berry aromas are gamy almost to an extreme. This multigrape blend has a lot of Syrah and Carmenère in it and that shows. The palate is muscular in feel and quite meaty and rustic in flavors with tastes of olive and beef jerky. A blackened finish is more dark and oaky than fruity.,Chile,Red Blend
This is a rich and heady Cabernet from head to toe. Solid ripe blackberry and cassis aromas are coated with oaky coconut scents. In the mouth this is saturated and heavy to the point of being syrupy. Flavors of chocolate oaky char and herbal berry flavors finish smoky and spicy. Drink through 2020.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Massive and dark up front with gritty aromas of herb cola and black olive. It feels chunky ripe and full bodied bearing an herbal minty flavor and notes of black fruit licorice and earth. A chocolate/carob flavor marks the finish.,Chile,Carmenère
Balsam wood floral berry and herbal aromas rest in front of a crisp fresh palate with raw acidity and clampy tannins. Olive pepper herbal and foresty fruit flavors announce a medium-weight snappy finish with no obvious oak. This is very nice but at $125 a bottle it has its limits.,Chile,Red Blend
Initially this doesn't distinguish itself. The nose deals typical Chilean Chardonnay aromas of corn and stalks along with warm-weather fruits. In the mouth however this is minerally and intense with driving acidity pushing flavors of oak cinnamon toast and baked apple. On the finish the fruit fades rather quickly while vanilla and resiny oak flavors settle in and take over.,Chile,Chardonnay
Great wine and great value too. The nose is a blend of floral graphite and cassis aromas while the firm and rugged palate is packed with sweet friendly cookie chocolate coffee and berry flavors. If the tannins seem a little aggressive now time should come to the rescue. Otherwise there's very little to pick at and a lot more to praise.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Big and saturated is the best way to describe this mammoth blend of Cabernet Carmenère and Cab Franc. It's full of ripe fruit coconut and cassis on the nose. Next up is a pure bulky palate of raspberry plum and vanilla. There's some sweet resiny oak notes if you dig deep but overall it is a high-end structured red blend. Drink now through 2012.,Chile,Cabernet Blend
Santa Carolina's Reserva de Familia red wines from 2007 are vastly improved from what the winery has done for the past two decades. This wine—along with the RdF Cabernet Sauvignon—show immense color and fruit but also balance structure and a friendliness that can't be mass produced. This wine is loaded with cassis cherry cola mint toast and bacon. And for $15 you'd be hard-pressed to find a better more complete red from anywhere in the world.,Chile,Carmenère
Tropical is how to best describe the bouquet; it's melony and sweet but not that zesty or pungent. The palate is round and works well while flavors of orange pith lime and sweet grapefruit are just lively enough. Drink now or wait for the 2010.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Toasty on the nose with plenty of baked apple and warmth. The palate is round smooth and toasty with caramel running alongside baked apple and pear flavors. Sweet on the finish plump in feel and good overall in a tropical fun way.,Chile,Chardonnay

Rubbery dark-fruit aromas are surrounded by hints of olive minerals and spice. This feels round as well as fair and balanced; flavors of loamy blackberry are smooth and come with chocolate notes. Coffee spice and herbal flavors work the finish.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Firm pinched aromas of rubbery berry and red fruits feed into a narrow tomatoey palate with crisp drawing acidity and tannins. This Carignan-led blend of five grapes is herbal and briny tasting with tomato cassis and red-berry flavors. Length balance and drive push an herbal finish to a good ending.,Chile,Red Blend
A full spectrum of Chilean SB aromas are present from grass to citrus to tropical fruits to vegetal notes. This feels fresh but more or less regular. Flavors of green fruits come with grassy interjections while the finish is good and clean.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Fairly oaky dark and baked but also well balanced and complete. The nose starts with vanilla and toast and then asphalt chocolate and black cherry come into play. In the mouth it's round and comfortable with raspberry plum and herbal flavors. Smooth but short on the finish with coffee and additional herb notes. Drink now.,Chile,Shiraz
A rock-solid wine with bright currant berry and rooty cola-infused aromas. The mouthfeel is excellent and integrated with earthy savory spicy flavors of blackberry cherry and tea. Long and savory on the finish with complexity. Wines like this are what make the Chilean Carignan category worth exploring. Drink now through 2012.,Chile,Carignan
The nose on this three-grape blend of Carmenère Petit Verdot and Shiraz is a bit funky and herbal with metallic notes and tomato to go with roast plum and heavy spice. It's lively and shows kick in the mouth while the flavors are oaky spicy and end with dry raspberry and oak-based vanilla.,Chile,Red Blend
Complex on the nose with leather dried flowers tobacco licorice coconut and cassis aromas. It's solid as a rock on the palate with herbal spicy flavors of mature berry fruits and raisin. Spicy and a touch hot on the finish. Drink now through 2015.,Chile,Red Blend
We haven't seen anything labeled Trio for years but the return of this Concha y Toro brand seems solid. Aromas of orange blossom lime and other green fruits are good while flavors of citrus grapefruit and cucumber are fresh and appealing. A good but standard wine that is lifted by a touch of green herb and brine.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Spritzy and spunky but already the flavors seems to be on the way out. The bouquet is salinic and narrow with more sea water and clam shell than bright forward fruit scents. Still this is true Chilean SB so there's ample melon apple and other green flavors including bell pepper.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Fresh but not overly racy with apple and pear aromas. There's ample snap and pop to the palate but not a whole lot of body or specificity of flavors. That said the tastes of lemon and green apple are clean albeit shallow and the finish is more of the same. Drink now.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Black-plum and apple-skin aromas are fruity and a bit raw. In the mouth this blend of Cabernet Franc Syrah Carmenère and Petit Verdot is full properly tannic and loamy in feel.

Gritty initial aromas of coffee grinds balsamic vinegar and sassy berry fruits open this Cabernet-led blend that includes Petit Verdot Carmenère and Cabernet Franc. Blackened flavors of berry fruits are offset by spice olive and herbal notes. On the finish oaky spice and modest acidity are lasting. Drink through 2020.,Chile,Red Blend
Aromas of graham cracker and chocolaty fruit yield something similar to berry pie. The mouth is grapey and full with sizable tannins and not much finesse. With airing this wine grows more cumbersome and untamed.,Chile,Merlot
The nose is flat and not very expressive. The flavors are of sweet fruit but beyond that they are hard to describe. A midland wine with a simple clean finish and a bit of a waxy mouthfeel.,Chile,Chardonnay
The nose is murky and overdone seemingly a victim of the rainy 2002 harvest. The palate is heavy and dark with sweet plum and berry fruit but not the pulsating pure type normally sought.,Chile,Merlot
Apricot aromas with flavors of green apple cucumber and green bean. The finish is clean and easy but bland. This wine does nothing to offend but it doesn't do much to impress either.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Piercing aromas but not very fruity. It's a bit like wasabe at the sushi joint. The palate has some cassis cherry and spice while the finish is also spicy. At first it shows some power but things fade fast as opposed to improving.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Flat and dull in the nose with only a touch of apple along with plenty of leftover wood. The palate is thick and woody and there just isn't ample fruit to offset the oakiness.,Chile,Chardonnay
Earthy berry aromas are a touch heavy and raisiny with horse and leather notes. A full chunky palate is more dense than expansive while this tastes of baked plum and prune. Hard tannins are drawing on a full-size finish. Drink the ripest and heaviest of Garage's 2014 Carignans through 2021.,Chile,Carignan
Touches of tree bark barrel spice and olive accent core berry and black currant aromas. A jammy widespread palate offers its fair share of tannic bite while flavors of berry fruits cassis and brown sugar are a bit overripe and syrupy in front of a heavy finish.,Chile,Red Blend

For a first effort from Casablanca Viu Manent has hit a home run. This wine is a classic New World Chard meaning it's liberally oaked vibrant ripe and full of tropical fruit.

Still Emiliana's vineyards are organically farmed and this five-grape blend made by Alvaro Espinoza is intense and extracted yet still finely knit. It's a serious wine with slight herbal/pine aromas robust red-fruit flavors and a smooth stylish finish. Not overdone so drink now.,Chile,Red Blend

A lightly woody finish with pepper and cocoa notes provides for a happy ending. Drink through 2020.,Chile,Red Blend
Jammy berry aromas are touched up in a good way by spicy notes of good oak and chocolate. A solid ripe palate feels right and balanced. Mellow but thorough berry fruit and oak flavors linger easily on a finish with chocolate and muted oak notes. Drink through 2022.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Warm and mulchy at first; this is a muscular dark wine despite the bargain price and it's tight tannic and herbal but serious in weight structure and depth. The palate shows creamy oaky herbal fruit in front of a full grabby tobacco-accented finish. Elevated size and structure is what brings it up a notch.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon

After an early blast of mint and menthol the nose works its way toward solid berry spice and vanilla flavors. The finish is round and moderately long with no sharp angles or jagged edges. Good yet standard Merlot at a welcome price point.,Chile,Merlot
A good effort given the price. Although the nose is a little bland the wine is clean and shows hints of pear and sweet grapefruit.

A lightweight made for limited-thought quaffing which is exactly what you should expect for eight bucks.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
There's something plaguing the nose here: talcum powder? air freshener? Whatever it seems powdery and a touch artificial. The palate features soft flavors of green bean and orange juice and the mild vegetal character carries onto the finish. Plump with some friendliness but a touch green.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
The bouquet delivers moderate citrus and snap while the palate offers midlevel varietal flavors of lime and generic citrus.

This Carignan from Cachapoal is one of Santa Ema's best wines year in and year out. This vintage is woodsy and dark on the nose with boysenberry jam and shoe-polish aromas. It's tannic and powerful for sure with flavors of ripe tomato graphite black plum herbs and even salt. A rugged briny tasting finish confirms the inherent rustic character of Carignan. Drink through 2019.,Chile,Carignan

The palate has a tartaric imprint while flavors of vanilla blackberry cassis and green herbs finish oaky and with plenty of leftover vanilla and tobacco. Drink through 2020.,Chile,Red Blend
A bit green and ashy with aromas of green bean green tobacco and bell pepper. It's not over-the-top vegetal but it does deal plenty of green bean and celery in addition to tangerine. As a whole it's wet and easy on the palate but it doesn't have the clarity of flavor and pure fruit that we're seeking from Leyda and Chile as a whole.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Slightly sweet and powdery smelling with simple creaminess to the orange-influenced nose. The palate is solid and plump with basic citrus flavors that shouldn't steer you wrong. Nice feel and a good but regular finish seal the deal.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Easygoing on the nose with light melon and green-fruit aromas. Yet it's crisp in the mouth but sort of choppy and tart as well. The wine is refreshing but short and linear as if some of the pulp and power were siphoned off. What's left is fresh and lasting but a little weak in flavor.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
A little soft and heavy on the nose which conveys a sense of overripeness. In the mouth it's not overly heavy but it is sort of chunky as flavors of apple and citrus brush up against mealy but then draw back to a fresher place. Finishes mild with only a modicum of acidity. Drink soon for best results.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Fleshy peach melon and papaya aromas set up a round pulpy full-bodied palate housing a creamy weight. Grapefruit lime melon and guava flavors finish a bit herbal with shades of tarragon.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Aromas of brambly plum and raspberry set up a palate with ripe flavors of black cherry and nutmeg. A baking-spice character carries onto the finish which turns more soft and candied as it wraps up.,Chile,Pinot Noir

Heavy oak vanilla and lightly herbal black-fruit aromas are savory and border on soupy. In the mouth this is rich saturated and jammy. Flavors of maple chocolate and toast accent fully extracted dark-fruit flavors. Full chewy tannins result in a pounding finish. Drink through 2022.,Chile,Malbec
Dark in appearance with reduced grapy inky aromas this compact Carmenère nearly collapses under its own weight. Heavily toasted blackberry flavors finish stout with blackened spice notes. If there's a knock on this blockbuster it's that it lacks layering and elegance.,Chile,Carmenère
As always this is among the best Malbecs Chile has to offer. The nose is concentrated and packed with huge aromas of black fruit vanilla and earthy tobacco. It feels pure and incredibly deep with beefy berry and toasted plum flavors. The chewy easy-to-like finish is mellow. Drink now–2017.,Chile,Malbec
Leather and scents of horse hide mesh with baked stewy aromas of plum berry and exotic spices. This feels lush and mostly well balanced with a level of ripeness and richness that doesn't veer into jamminess. This is rustic tasting with roasted leafy berry flavors along with chocolate and herbs.,Chile,Syrah
Dark toasty and leathery on the nose but also earthy rubbery and herbal. Shows good body on the palate with oaky lightly medicinal flavors of herbal plum and raspberry. The finish lingers with herbal flavors and a healthy feel.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon

Lightly herbal and light in body with earthy aromas that include leather tea and dried fruits. This is medium-bodied in style with elegance. Problem is there isn't much substance to it and compared to Chile's better Cabs it pales in flavor and generosity. Also the finish is kind of scratchy and thin.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Aromas of pear citrus and almond should be familiar to anyone who knows Chilean Chardonnay but to call this wine elevated or beyond regular would be a stretch. The palate is slightly lemony and green and the finish has a persistent tang. Seems like basic Casablanca Chard to us.,Chile,Chardonnay
Bold and saturated to the eye with black fruit olive and other slightly herbal aromas. But where this wine loses points is in the mouth. It's sharp and overtly acidic which makes the cola and cherry flavors ring and seem tangy. Thus it finishes short and scouring.,Chile,Merlot
Brushy herbal aromas include saucy notes of cherry tomato and iodine. This mystery blend from a 60-year-old vineyard in Curicó is medium in body with salty savory plum flavors. Briny notes and saltiness outmaneuver the wine's fruit content on the finish.,Chile,Red Blend

Pithy citrus and nectarine aromas announce a palate that's citrusy all the way. Flavors of orange lemon and grapefruit keep a persistent citric character through the finish which is basic but refreshing.,Chile,Chardonnay
Basic aromas of spiced plum cassis and black cherry set up a similar set of flavors while the feel is pure clean and easygoing. This is a no-nonsense familiar type of mass-market Cabernet. It's generic in its approach and it doesn't vary much along the way.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Quiet on the nose and 100% inoffensive. The palate hints at bell pepper and green bean while also dealing ample pineapple and citrus. Turns a little tart and lean on the back end but that frames the wine's freshness zest and energy. Another good Sauvignon Blanc from Chile that's made to drink now.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
The overriding sentiment is that Limarí is too cool for Carmenère yet this wine while a bit sour and rhubarby is still pretty comfy and satisfying. The flavors rest on plum blackberry and wood while olive and carob control the finish. Falls off at the end but good overall. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company LLC.,Chile,Carmenère
A little bit wild and sauvage as Merlot from Chile is known to be. Flavors of herbal berry fruit and plum work the core while the finish is woody and resiny but also a little zingy and acidic. Not so much tart but definitely a little more snappy and “red” than the norm.,Chile,Merlot

This smells reedy and like beets blended with mint and other green herbs. The palate has a shrill feel while the flavors trend toward herbal red plum salt and oak. A green-leaning finish is choppy and high in acid.,Chile,Pinot Noir
This bodega always puts out a charred roasted Carmenère and this keeps the tradition going. Burnt roasted aromas of coffee campfire and blackberry lead to a full but angular feeling palate with vinegar-like acidity. Herbal clipped flavors are mostly charred while herbal black-fruit flavors vie with even more char on the finish.,Chile,Carmenère
Oily salinic aromas of match stick and pickled white fruits offer up a pinched palate with briny stalky flavors of burnt orange and passion fruit. A briny tasting clampy finish doesn't do much to bring this around.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc

Cherry and berry aromas are basic and just good enough. This smacks down hard in the mouth with acidity while flavors of tomato red plum and medicinal berry end short and without a lot of substance.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Peach and melon aromas help define what amounts to a tropical smelling bouquet. A tight lemony palate offers a firm mouthfeel while bright citrus flavors are dominant but fail to bring much else to the table. The finish offers banana and vanilla flavors before dropping off.,Chile,Chardonnay
The nose is slightly creamy due to overt oak and it's also somewhat disjointed what with both bold berry fruit and a strong whiff of wet dog. In the mouth things quickly turn grapey and then that overt fruitiness morphs into cherry and espresso. Meanwhile bursting acidity throughout keeps it lively and fresh. Best Buy.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon

The old-vine name is French as are the estate owners and the wine itself is pretty good despite being a bit thick chewy and aimless.

Mouthfeel is its primary attribute while interesting or unusual tastes prove elusive.,Chile,Chardonnay
Here's a good example of a value Chardonnay. It's clean and fruity with spicy apple flavors a focused and lengthy finish and proper acidity. The whole is better than its parts.,Chile,Chardonnay
The bouquet is closed with only a touch of prune plum and cranberry aromas emerging. On the palate is raspberry fruit a hint of veggies and some tight tannins.

Spicy dry and showing cassis and berry aromas this is a textbook Chilean Cabernet. A tight tannic palate stops short of grating while spicy berry and toast flavors offer a touch of oaky mocha. The finish is mild and echoes with the flavors that came before it.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
This smells typical of coastal Chilean SB meaning it's citrusy and green but the nose seems a touch flat. Not so the palate which is snappy and juicy. Flavors of grapefruit and passion fruit lead the way with a backing of green bean and mild bell pepper controlling a crisp fresh finish.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
This opens with aromas of blackberry cassis and leather. The palate is full and fairly lush with firm rubbery tannins. Ripe leathery blackberry and chocolate flavors finish long and with modest tannin-driven clamp.,Chile,Cabernet Franc
Alert but a bit yeasty on the nose with notes of citrus tropical fruits and green herbs filling things out this is weighty and mature with acidity to spare but also some creaminess to the palate. Briny salty flavors of orange tangerine and lime finish long and reflective of the Pacific Ocean which isn't far from the vineyard that yielded this new-to-the-market SB.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Meaty earthy aromas of mixed berry fruits show a fair amount of wood. The palate is ripe and blocky with black-fruit flavors primarily blackberry and plum accented by a noticeable herbal element. Toasty and spicy on the finish this is a commendable value-priced Carmenère.,Chile,Carmenère

Muted citrus and white-fruit aromas blend on the nose with briny sea notes. This offers a plump palate and flavors of bitter citrus salt and pepper. A sense of citrus skins creates pulling tension on the finish.,Chile,Chardonnay
This black wine is so ripe it's syrupy. Dense aromas of blackberry raisin cassis liqueur and perfume push the limit while licorice prune raisin blueberry and chocolate flavors end in a sticky slow-moving finish with a lot of weight. This tastes every bit like a warm-climate wine.,Chile,Syrah
The nose on this basic Sauvignon is likeable with moderate citric bite and zing. It's smooth and tasty in the mouth with lime tangerine passion fruit and minerality. A cleansing smooth finish confirms the wine's quality. It says a lot for the potential of Chilean SB.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Tan in color and bland as a whole with vanilla and pear aromas that do little to allure or entice. Strained and pickled tasting with a heavy overdone overall style. Pushes the definition of “acceptable.”,Chile,Chardonnay
Smells strange as if juniper berries were blended with tomato and weedy red fruits. Scratchy and herbal in the mouth with game and other oddball flavors. Finishes gummy and confected with a final blast of green herbs and weeds.,Chile,Syrah
Heavy and soupy in its current state. This is one chunked-out white wine that is barely hanging on with flavors of papaya and dried-out peach. Has lost whatever freshness it may have had.,Chile,Viognier

Oxidized and mute with mushy nutty flavors and a similar finish. An underperformer that lacks freshness purity and character.,Chile,Chardonnay
Overly perfumed with burnt notes wayward sulfur and acridness at the wine's core. The palate is fleshy and low in acidity with bitterness to the white fruit flavors that are none too clean. Offers very little that's redeeming.,Chile,Viognier
If you like a ton of oak then this may be up your alley. Early aromas of tea and cherry quickly step aside as heavy toasted wood notes take over. The palate is full and round with weight thickness and heavy berry and chocolate flavors. There's some Pinot character here but put it on the scale and it's going to weigh out on the heavy side. To our taste it's very New World and clumsy.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Fairly hot and heavy at first as alcohol blows up your nostrils. But let it settle and you'll get dark sultry aromas of leather and black plum in front of edgy mildly citric cassis and red plum flavors. The blend is Carmenère Petit Verdot and Shiraz which is not something found on every shelf. Like its Cab Franc-Petit Verdot partner Anke Blend-2 is good but not great.,Chile,Red Blend

Crisp snap-pea and cucumber aromas are lightly citric. This feels fresh tangy and citric with plenty of acidic cut. Lime pea and bell pepper flavors are about as true to Chilean SB as it gets.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc

Even among value-priced Cabs from Chile this one isn't offering much. The nose is sharp and brambly with a hint of stem that takes a while to loosen its grip. The palate is made up of bitter-tinged raspberry flavors and short choppy tannins. Seems more short on substance than in the past.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Powdery and sweet smelling with an acidic palate propelling pedestrian green apple lime and orange flavors. Fruity but not very refined with a tenuous balance that indicates that it should be drunk as soon as possible.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc

A real South American take on this French grape. The nose is savory and smoky with deep berry and vanilla aromas.

Not much in the way of aromas except for flatness and apple juice. This wine is a cipher for the most part; it has flat apple and lemon flavors and then a maderized finish that is wheaty and suggests vanilla. Not fully vital; could already be past its prime.,Chile,Chardonnay
Sulfur and matchstick on the nose is offputting while what remains suggests oily green fruits. The palate is sharp and acidic with green fruit flavors and a sharpness that suggests salad with vinaigrette. Doesn't click really.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc

Aggressive early on with foxy briary aromas of turned earth olive rhubarb and green tobacco. The palate is fleshy soft and welcoming but the flavors are a sketchy amalgam of bramble leather and herbal raspberry. Mouthfeel is the best part.,Chile,Carmenère
The bouquet suggests burnt rubber compost and briar patch along with basic raspberry/cherry. The palate has a mild creaminess to it and herbal lightly stemmy flavors of raspberry and rhubarb. Finishes tart with herbs and vanilla.,Chile,Pinot Noir
For a rosé this wine is hefty and bold with strawberry and plum flavors with a dash of earthiness. One reviewer found it too creamy; another found lots to like about its spicy fresh-herb finish. With such diverse evaluations this is a wine to try for yourself.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Smoke and a refreshing minty note open this Casablanca Valley Pinot. Black cherry and plum flavors are backed by smoke and syrupy molasses notes. Mouthfeel is on the rich side; finishes with modest tannins and spicy briary flavors.,Chile,Pinot Noir

Plastic rubber and latex aromas dominate the nose on this Carmenère. Tomatoey cloying and tannic in the mouth the palate tastes mostly of carob oak and herbal berry fruits.,Chile,Carmenère

Chunky lightly vegetal green-fruit aromas are authentic for Casablanca SB. This has a full slightly oily feel with girth and weight. Punchy tart citrus and green-fruit flavors finish with lime bell pepper and jalapeño notes.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
The Massenez family from Alsace is to thank for this Bordeaux blend which offers fleshy dusty black-plum and red-berry fruit flavors and a medium-long finish rife with oak and red berry. The nice nougaty-marscapone aromas are unfortunately overtaken by oak.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
This wine has such nice hickory dried-spice and red-berry notes it'd be a shame to drink it anywhere but outside on your deck with some slow-cooked baby back ribs. Medium-weight with some chalky tannins it finishes with more of the same flavors plus some char and green herb. Fire up the grill. Best Buy.,Chile,Carmenère
Bright but tart cherry and blackberry flavors are swathed in dusty tannins; the nose offers similar berry and plum aromas. It's a little acidic but finishes with nice dusty-plum flavors.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Snappy and pure aromas grace the nose with Bartlett pear lees and toasty oak most prominent. The palate is overt and fruity featuring apple and citrus flavors accented by bright acidity. This seems like a fine appetizer by-the-glass or party-friendly wine but the composite cork the winery is using is madness to get off the corkscrew. Best Buy.,Chile,Chardonnay
Black fruit up front has an earthy composty quality; the palate's mixed berries take a back seat to wood. Persistent herb and white-pepper flavors on the finish persist longer than I wanted them to. A rustic rough-around-the-edges wine that begs for stew or black beans.,Chile,Syrah
A chalky dusty mouthfeel nicely balances this Petite Syrah's bright full blackberry and blueberry fruit. Wheat-flour and black-pepper notes add interest to the bouquet; the wine finishes with herb and an acorny nuttiness. A good first Chilean wine for those more comfortable with the Californian style. It's got tannins to lose but it's very good.,Chile,
It's easy to see Rothschild's Bordeaux influence in this one—it's more about chalky minerally tannins than oak and offers mixed berries on both palate and nose. An acorn nuttiness and some dried spices linger throughout. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon Cabernet Franc and Carmenère. Best Buy.,Chile,Bordeaux-style Red Blend

Mildly snappy nettle passion fruit and tangerine aromas are a nice entry to this spunky but basic SB. Lime and tarragon flavors quickly fall off on a light finish.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Slightly oxidized on the nose this is low on fruit aromas but not unappealing. A plump palate offers flavors of corn banana and melon. Firm acidity keeps this pumping on the finish.,Chile,Chardonnay

One of Chile's benchmark wines is typically clean pure and inviting. The nose is ripe and lusty while the palate is vital juicy fresh and crisp with fine Cabernet flavors of black currant cherry chocolate and more. Probably the closest thing in style to great Napa Valley Cab; deep dense and long on the finish. A hearty but refined wine to drink now through 2017.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Given that 2009 was a hot vintage in Chile it's not shocking that this old vine Cabernet is rich ripe and syrupy.

This finishes a touch choppy and rough with weight and power. Drink through 2016.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
This is opaque in color with oaky balsamic aromas of black fruits mint and vanilla. In the mouth this is muscular with full and somewhat rough tannins.

A thick slathering of oak gives this Malbec a plastic-like coating on the nose; in addition there are aromas of brushy herbal berry fruits. This is chunky and plump in feel with herbal oaky minty flavors that outweigh the wine's berry character. The finish is hot and oaky.,Chile,Malbec

The fruit is sweet and direct just the kind of thing that would hit the spot with an impromptu meal of steak frites. No there's not a lot of structure but why age a wine that's so clearly made for immediate gratification?,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
A light and crisp Chardonnay that leans more to the style of Mâcon than Monterey. Mild apple peach tropical fruit and citrus notes on the nose open to a dry slightly reserved palate with orange and spice elements. Bright acidity keeps it lively and it finishes dry with a classy slightly chalky note.,Chile,Chardonnay
Young and grapy with plenty of heavily toasted oak this is one Chilean red that could use a year or so to settle down. Right now the fruit is just too unformed and the charred oak too unintegrated but the solid raw materials should knit together nicely in a relatively short time.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
There's very juicy jammy red berry fruit here and the round even soft palate may lack a bit of structure but this is a flavorful very approachable wine.

At this price you can expect an honest workmanlike everyday wine and you get that here—along with other qualities that will surprise you.

Ripe pear-pineapple fruit is layered with vanilla and tinged with citrus. This is a plump slightly heavy Chard best served cold at parties and picnics.,Chile,Chardonnay
Straightforward punchbowl aromas greet you and beyond that there's melon to the nose.

An easygoing likable and honest style of Sauvignon Blanc.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
The hot conditions of 2009 are draped all over this rich syrupy wine that's opaque to the eye and heavily charred on the nose.

The palate on this heavyweight is chewy while flavors of oak roasted berry and herbs lead to a mildly complex but forceful finish. This is more big and ripe than elegant.,Chile,Syrah

Finishes with a hint of tobacco and easy tannins. Altogether quite impressive especaially for a wine from such a difficult vintage.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Sure cedar and chocolate are the dominant aromas and flavors but there's enough blueberry fruit to stand up to the oak rather nicely.

A little oaky but shows a degree of finesse not often found in Chilean wines at this level.,Chile,Merlot
Hooray for the fruit on this beauty!  Gobs of freshly crushed blackberries blueberries plums espresso black currants and vanilla are charming and the flavors are every bit as lush.  Technically it's bone dry but it's one of those wines that tastes fruity sweet.  It has elegance and style that belie the value price. Plus the tannins are soft as velvet,Chile,Merlot

This is a lovely wine and one of the best values of the year in Sauvignon/Fume Blanc.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
This individualistic Chardonnay has a lot to offer. The nose is ripe with floral honey and even petrol notes and opens to a palate of tangerine and lychee nut-like flavors.  The mouthfeel is round and smooth; the sweet and sour finish dry and spicy. Reminiscent of some Alsatian whites and worthy of notice for its flavorful uniqueness.,Chile,Chardonnay

Drinks well now and may improve over two or three years.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
A great price for a wine this rich and spicy. It's busting with ripe tropical fruit peach tangerine and pear notes and spices too. And it's dry with just a hint of residual sugar to make the fruit round and forward. Turns really pretty on the polished spicy finish.,Chile,Chardonnay
This is a very distinctive even eccentric Cab that must reflect its single-vineyard terroir.  The usual black-currant and blackberry notes are there but the aroma is sharply dominated by an herbal streak somewhat stalky or green as if some of the grapes didn't ripen.  Tastes a little sharp.  Purists might want to age it for 3-5 years to see if it softens up.,Chile,Cabernet Blend
Ripe berries black cherries earth chocolate and herbs all mark this nose of this solid Merlot. Fairly full on the palate it has a supple feel and plum and berry flavors. The finish is reserved maybe even a bit austere with dry semisweet chocolate notes on the tart plum fruit.,Chile,Merlot
Slightly fat figgy aromas with notes of thyme and mint give way to a round palate and flavors of citrus and fig. The mouthfeel has just a touch of youthful fizz and the finish is long and nutty with a reprise of herbs.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
A scratchy rough nose with forced creamy oak aromas is also a bit fiery and hot. A heavy palate with surface-level oak tastes more of clove and cured beef than honest fruit. A sticky cloying palate is creamy and overtly oaky.,Chile,Carmenère
Resiny oak and wallflower fruit aromas lead to a palate that's thick and sticky. This tastes woody and barrel heavy with little to no fruit. On the finish a tropical note of banana is offset by briny saltiness.,Chile,Chardonnay
Maple and clove aromas scream of oak and not toasty spicy oak. Following suit this is creamy and less than fluent on the palate. Furthermore this tastes of clove and creamy oak more than actual fruit.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Harsh fruitless aromas of green bean and ashtray come before a raw palate that's far from welcoming. Choppy herbal plum flavors are grassy while the finish offers nothing new or different.,Chile,Carmenère
Starts out kind of murky and pasty with gummy black fruit and compost aromas. Airing helps it escape that shell and in the mouth there's rubbery blueberry flavors mixed with mildly tart rhubarb and bramble. Good enough but doesn't do much to push the envelope that is Chilean Syrah.,Chile,Syrah
Quite raisiny with an overweight personality conveyed through the nose. The palate is tannic with black cherry and cola flavors thickened up by a full dose of raisin. Very sweet on the finish but also hard and baked. Still reasonably good but it's less well balanced than in previous vintages.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Lime aromas and modest minerality are proper given its origin but it turns softer and sweeter the more time it airs out. The palate is fairly round with lemon-lime and pineapple flavors. Citric if a bit pithy on the finish. Fine but average.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
San Vicente is part of the Casa Donoso group and this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon Carmenère Malbec and Cabernet Franc smells tarry and blackened with notes of olive char cassis and minerals. The full layered palate is meaty and integrated while flavors of spiced blackberry cassis and pepper end in toasty dark and lightly herbal fashion. Drink through 2022.,Chile,Red Blend
Heady oaky pushy aromas of green-leaning red-berry fruits and coffee grinds are earthy and strong. This is concentrated in the mouth and also pasty and resiny in feel. Flavors of lactic oak cardamom and blackberry finish with vanilla sweetness and a lasting wave of wood.,Chile,Carmenère
With heavy notes of botrytis and oak this is reflective of the European style of sweet whites. The palate is fleshy but not terribly precise while flavors of caramel butter and baked apple finish modest and shy on acidity.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
For Chilean Sauvignon Blanc with character style and panache Kingston Family's Cariblanco is a perennial pace-setter. There's mineral sea air and tropical fruit aromas to get it going. Next in line is a flush palate of passion fruit and green apple. Finishes long and stylish with elegance.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Very nicely done with full-force berry and plum balancing off mild vegetal/herbal aromas. The palate is ripe round and textured with alluring plum berry leather and vanilla flavors. It folds in cinnamon and pepper on the finish to bring everything full circle while keeping the herbal element under control; 60% Carmenère and 40% Malbec.,Chile,Red Blend
A recommended Chardonnay that's a step or two up from this country's norm. Vanilla toast and apple aromas set the stage for lively apple peach and melon flavors. Honey and toast work the finish and overall it blends tropical power and sweetness with subtleties and some elegance.,Chile,Chardonnay
A full warm big-fruited Cab with savory meaty oaky overtones to go with solid acid-rich berry fruit and vanilla flavors. Definitely oaky but not roasted like many Terranoble wines. Shows slight heat and rubbery qualities but overall it's a good hardy Cabernet with serious fruit and structure.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Aromas of sweet berry fruit and cherry lean toward medicinal. The palate is juicy due to bold acidity and the flavors settle on main street cherry. There's a buttery oak note on the finish but overall it's more basic and fruity than supple and complex.,Chile,Red Blend
Spiced gumdrop and rooty sweetness carry the massive nose to a big but balky palate of baked roasted black fruits cassis and tire rubber. There's sweetness beef marshmallow and burn along with tannic weight and grab. A lot of power; needs more touch. Believe it or not Medalla Real Cabernet is now a 73000-case product.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
A bit rough at first with aromas of burnt field corn and haystack. It gets fruitier with time and the palate is smooth despite offering a lot of citrus and pineapple flavors. Finishes both lively and a touch creamy with tang and vitality.,Chile,Chardonnay
Altaïr is a fortressed high-end Cabernet blend with mineral and charred aromas announcing a palate coated with dense berry flavors tobacco vanilla and balsamic notes. It's a complex wine that is fairly tough out of the bottle. Ideally it should be cellared for another three to five years.,Chile,Cabernet Blend
Aromas of fresh asphalt are gritty but mix nicely into lightly herbal black-fruit scents. This blend of 70% Cabernet and 30% Carmenère is hard-driving and firm. A collection of baked berry and spice flavors finish with mild oak tobacco and vanilla flavors. Drink through 2019.,Chile,Red Blend
Aromas of licorice nutmeg and blackberry come with herbal leafy notes. This feels plump with integrated acidity and a good texture. Notes of toast and pepper give complexity to core plum and olive flavors which are backed by an herbal toasty finish that sports some heat. Drink through 2018.,Chile,Red Blend
Briny citrus green melon bell pepper and grassy aromas are 100% coastal Chile. This has a citrusy yet round palate that's lively but not overtly complex. Salty briny flavors of lime and white grapefruit ride through the finish.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Somewhere between neutral and bland is where this wine's bouquet resides. The palate is plump feeling but stagnant with chunky apple and pithy citrus flavors. Bitterness comes up on the finish which is pithy as a whole.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Gritty herbal aromas of generic berry don't exactly draw you in. The palate on this rudimentary Cab is rather weak in structure with herbal slightly salty flavors of dry generic berry fruits.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
For a big simple style of Pinot Noir this gets the job done. It's dark and mulled on the nose with boistrous plum and cherry flavors that darken up and turn peppery on the finish. This emphasizes freshness and size more than finesse.,Chile,Pinot Noir
The nose is appealing; there's a mix of wet clay spice red currant and herbs. In the mouth however this is tangy to the max with tart red plum pie cherry and vanilla flavors. By the time it finishes acidity has assumed the throne. This is extremely lean and zesty for Cab Franc.,Chile,Cabernet Franc
Gritty spicy aromas of kirsch dried cherry and cinnamon set up a narrow high-acid palate that's fresh but grating. Baking spice eucalyptus and tomato accent plum and red-currant fruit while the finish tastes herbal spicy and oaky with lasting acidity.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
The nose delivers a mix of herbal berry cola and earth while the palate is fresh and deep with lightly medicinal cherry cola blackberry tobacco mocha and more. Finishes rich and chocolaty with a rush of textbook Chilean flavors including tobacco herbs olive and black fruits.,Chile,Red Blend
Intense and dark with an oily nose of mineral leather and mocha along with ripe berry fruit notes. The blend (50% Carmenère 40% Cab Sauvignon 10% Syrah) works like a charm. The flavors settle on lightly herb-infused berry flavors and chocolate while the finish is on the spot. Rich ripe and with modest tannins; drink now–2009.,Chile,Red Blend
Some of the best-bred Carmenères in the world are grown in Peumo and a star example is this saturated minty wine with medium-weight tannins and a long finish. It's lush powerful and along the way you taste pepper chocolate berries and sunshine.,Chile,Carmenère
Opens with true citrus nettle and other snappy prickly aromas. Like many Chilean SBs it's fresh and charging with zesty green-fruit and citrus flavors. Lime is present on the finish as is a touch of lasting bitterness. Good but straightforward and slightly narrow.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Whispy and lightweight on the nose with hints of celery sweat and passion fruit. There's not a ton to say about this pedestrian but well-made Sauvignon. It is citrusy with a touch of bell pepper and it finishes in a comfortable way. Classic everyday SB from Casablanca is what this tastes smells and feels like. Drink now.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Intensely charred and rubbery with peanutty aromas that also fold in fresh-laid road tar. Gotta say this is unusual for Maipo and Chilean Cabernet; it's herbal with a green infiltration. Bouncy on the finish with grabby tannins. It's almost there but too many speed bumps don't allow for smooth driving.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Angular and piquant on the nose with tight aromas of red zinger tea fresh herbs and raspberry. This is a Pinot made in a light coastal style; it offers red cherry cough drop and tea-like flavors in front of a lasting unforced but mild finish. A year in French oak has added a buttery element and overall the wine rings true but distant.,Chile,Pinot Noir
A bit of volatility and jamminess is acceptable here because overall the wine is good. The nose mixes graphite and cassis with leather and earth to give a sense of good things to come while the palate is snappy and properly tannic with nice black cherry plum and chocolate flavors. Solid and sturdy; 60% Cabernet and 40% Merlot.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Slightly oily and lemony on the nose but there's also some sauvage character along with berry aromas. The palate can be best described as “juicy” which means the acidity is fairly high and the extract level not all that thick. And with red berry and plum flavors in front of a short finish this one is ready to drink now.,Chile,Syrah
Approach this unusual Chilean white with no preconceptions and you will like it. The nose is tropical and floral with aromas of green melon air freshener citrus blossom and more. The palate feel is in harmony while the flavors of melon kiwi and apple work well together. Finishes dry with green-fruit flavors and washing acidity.,Chile,Gewürztraminer
Aromas of stewed berry fruits olive and herbs combine to form a soupy bouquet. This is fairly racy with a touch of spiky tartaric acid creating mild astringency. Stewy roasted flavors of black fruits and carob finish herbal.,Chile,Carmenère
Apple and melon aromas are basic. This feels round with moderate acidity. Flavors of citrus peach and nectarine are competent while the finish takes on a salty note as it loses its fruit character.,Chile,Chardonnay
With a name like this it should come as no surprise that this is 85% Carmenère (with 15% Malbec and Syrah). This smells like pencil lead plastic and blueberry. In the mouth it's chunky but flat with flavors of plastic lactic oak and herbal berry fruits. A minty green finish is oaky and adequate.,Chile,Red Blend
Give this value-priced Pinot Noir its due given that production is nearly 300000 cases. Aromas of baked cherry cocoa and baking spices lead to a fresh palate with wiry acidity. Earthy slightly salty flavors of plum and currant finish steady.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Although this Cab is scratchy on the nose and palate it is fresh and cleanly made with black-fruit flavors spice and only a mild dose of Chile's patented minty green character. A monotone finish burns a bit but otherwise tastes right.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Ripe berry and cassis aromas are broadened by open-grain oak. This Cabernet is big and tannic. Toasty chocolaty berry flavors with a full complement of oaky support maintain a chocolaty essence on a finish that confirms how whole and thorough this is. Drink this warm-vintage wine through 2022.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Tight at first with aromas of olive brick dust cured cheese and dark fruit. The palate on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère (15%) is narrow but healthy. There's a tough juiciness to it and eventually it reveals black plum and cherry flavors along with a chocolaty finish that holds its pose until the cameras are off.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère
Quite Bordeaux in style meaning the wine is leaner tighter and more tannic than typical Southern Hemisphere blends usually amount to. But we very much like the wine's mineral plum and juicy raspberry flavors. All in all expect a sturdy well-made wine with plenty of natural and barrel-aided tannins. Will likely improve with another year or two in bottle.,Chile,Red Blend
Black fruit bacon and sawdust aromas introduce this fuller-styled fairly heady Merlot. With ripeness written all over it there's still plenty of liveliness and punch to the black cherry and blackberry flavors. Finishing notes of pepper and chocolate give it added character.,Chile,Merlot
A big blanket of oaky chocolaty minty aromas sits on top of herbal plum and cassis scents. No surprise that this is a big wine with loud plum blackberry and spice flavors but it's also a bit awkward in feel. On the finish this spreads apart at the seams leaving no cushion for scorching acidity and hard tannins. Drink through 2021.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Woodsy earthy berry aromas share the nose with fresh-cut oak scents. This Carmenère-Syrah blend feels lively and juicy not heavy or flat. Dark spicy berry and plum flavors include notes of olive and oak while the finish is spicy and tastes of olive and tobacco.,Chile,Carmenère-Syrah
A black color and baked ripe-fruit aromas are the greeting on this second wine to Clos Apalta. While this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon Carmenère Merlot and Petit Verdot feels soft along the edges it's propped up by tartaric acidity. Blackened flavors of saturated blackberry and cassis maintain lush ripeness across the finish. Drink through 2020.,Chile,Red Blend
Ripe blackberry and spice aromas are a touch meaty and earthy but mostly straightforward. A grabby fleshy palate is obtuse but still balanced while this tastes of berry and cassis which are textbook flavors for Cabernet Sauvignon. A dry woody finish with a chocolate note renders this better than most for $20.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Rubbery dark-fruit aromas are surrounded by hints of olive minerals and spice. This feels round as well as fair and balanced; flavors of loamy blackberry are smooth and come with chocolate notes. Coffee spice and herbal flavors work the finish.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Firm pinched aromas of rubbery berry and red fruits feed into a narrow tomatoey palate with crisp drawing acidity and tannins. This Carignan-led blend of five grapes is herbal and briny tasting with tomato cassis and red-berry flavors. Length balance and drive push an herbal finish to a good ending.,Chile,Red Blend
GSM means Grenache Syrah and Mourvèdre while the T stands for Tempranillo. On the nose it's spicy and a touch stalky and roasted. The mouthfeel is full and balanced while flavors of baked plum cassis cocoa and tea finish mellow with mild tannins.,Chile,Red Blend
Ripe jammy aromas of red currants and berries set up a linear-feeling palate that is ruled by zesty core acidity. This blend of Carignan Garnacha and Mataro tastes of snappy saucy red-berry fruits while the finish slings a bit of tomatoey tang. Drink through 2024.,Chile,Red Blend
Mildly roasted berry and asphalt aromas set up clean berry and plum flavors that also feature accents of herbs and olive. Tastes good and clean with nothing out of the ordinary. A little generic in the end but fine for everyday drinking.,Chile,Carmenère
Green inky reduced aromas are less than inviting. A saucy palate with heavy tannins delivers flavors of inky blueberry and green herbs much like the nose.,Chile,Carmenère
This bland overoaked Chardonnay is dilute with aromas of clove but no fruit. A watery palate tastes woody and bitter with another shot of unwanted clove on the finish.,Chile,Chardonnay
Ripe plum and berry aromas come with floral accents as well as touches of horse hide and leather. The palate is firm and direct with balanced tannins and acidity working with flavors of dark berry fruits chocolate pepper and spice. The finish is chocolaty with hints of vanilla herbs and heat.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
If your impression of South America Malbec has been shaped by Argentina then this Chilean example will be appealing. It's ripe and dense with blackberry and animal hide aromas. The palate is rock solid in feel with concentrated flavors of blackberry cassis cumin pepper and chocolate. This gets oakier darker and more compact on the finish.,Chile,Malbec
Very aromatic to the point of being flowery. The palate is sweet and dense with a heavy round mouthfeel and candied mango melon and applesauce flavors. Finishes just pure enough with weight and pith entering the fray. Don't wait long to drink.,Chile,Viognier
Leafy dry and earthy on the nose with a hint of flowery red fruit. The palate rings with sharp acidity which livens up blackberry herb black tea and carob flavors. Shows a lot of wayward unintegrated oak on the finish but stays bright due to juicy acidity.,Chile,Merlot
Fleshy melony scents kick it off. That set of aromas is followed by an acidic lively palate with generic slightly mealy flavors of peach citrus and light oak. Long but a little bitter on the finish but with good acid-driven zest.,Chile,Chardonnay
Warm and rubbery on the nose with earthy aromas of blackberry black cherry and freshly laid blacktop. The palate is full tannic and grapey with dark fruit flavors and an herbal element. Finishes short herbal and salty with lasting meatiness.,Chile,Shiraz
Strikingly pungent on first take with crackling aromas of cactus nettle lime and grapefruit. Feels zesty deep and layered with an even mix of tropical fruit flavors stone fruits and green notes. About as right as it gets for Chilean Sauvignon Blanc.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Good density and maybe a touch reduced this is a cool syrah with cola and chocolate accents. It's concentrated and meaty with chewy tannins and plenty of body. Call it a voluminous New World wine with ripe fruit and a distinct milk chocolate wave on the finish.,Chile,Syrah
Piercing aromas announce that this is no basic quaffer. The palate shows blazing acids that narrow everything down to citrus lemon underripe pineapple and Granny Smith apple flavors. While almost sour it's not with briney green fruit on a long scouring finish.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Petrol leads the nose which also deals pear and melon in a solid facsimile of Alsace. The palate is lemony and cut by streaking acidity while the flavors of citrus run tart and monotone. Finishes zesty with green apple and lemon.,Chile,Riesling
Dark and dense with prune-like aromas. It's powerful and forward with fudge plum and blackberry flavors on a full mildly tannic frame. Finishes with clamp-down bite and flavors of burnt toast and chocolate. Could stand to show more character and less generic black fruit.,Chile,Malbec
Blackberry and cassis aromas are a touch balsamic but mostly clean. This feels solid and hefty with slightly overripe black-fruit flavors. A low-acid finish results in flatness.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Snappy but briny citrus aromas include pyrazines. In the mouth this coastal product feels bouncy but regular. Citrusy flavors come with bell-pepper and celery notes while this is fresh on the finish but a touch green.,Chile,Rosé
Gritty oily nutty aromas lead to a tight citric palate. Salty narrow flavors of passion fruit and grapefruit finish steady and briny. Overall this is basic in every way.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Reedy plum and raspberry aromas are a touch floral. This feels highly regular while medicinal berry flavors carry a mild green and weedy side note. A finish with modest raspberry and cherry notes is par for the course.,Chile,Merlot
Basic berry and plum aromas are a bit foxy and herbal. This feels choppy and scratchy due to raw tannins. Generic black-fruit flavors are short and salty while this ends with a clipped feel and medicinal berry flavors.,Chile,Malbec
Clean but modest raspberry aromas set up a wiry palate. This tastes of tart plum tomato and herbs. A minty green note rises up on a snappy palate that includes a touch of oak.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Raspberry and strawberry aromas suggest fruit punch. This feels stocky and sticky due to low acidity. Flavors of plum and berry come with buttery oak notes while this is short and hollow on the finish.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Mild flowery aromas suggest lilac and bath soap. This feels plump and chunky with no distinct center point. Salty yeasty but bland flavors lead to an oily feeling finish with early onset oxidation.,Chile,Chardonnay
Rubbery blackberry aromas are dense and horsey. This feel wide and chunky but loose at the seams. Oaky flavors of generic black fruits finish medicinal and a touch candied.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Haras is the base-level label for Haras de Pirque and frankly this Chardonnay tastes smells and feels like a base-level wine. There's a damp lack of clarity on the nose as well as sweet apple cinnamon and spice flavors. Finishes fleshy and bland.,Chile,Chardonnay
Harsh and gaseous on the nose with rustic aromas and no sense of polish. Tastes like burnt sugar and melted candy with a soupy finish.,Chile,Syrah
Blueberry and raspberry aromas are front and center along with a hint of animal hide. In the mouth this is bullish ripe and generous with oak-rich flavors of vanilla baked berry fruit and spice. Licorice latent oak and heat work the finish on this ripe specimen. Among Chilean Syrahs this is a perennial pack leader.,Chile,Syrah
Plump and ready to drink this is big and meaty stuff and in the end it's like so many ultraripe fat Chardonnays from Chile. This doesn't mean that there isn't citrus on parade all ending in a finish on tangerine alley. If it lacks nuance it makes up for it in ripeness of fruit.,Chile,Chardonnay
Spice and pepper aromas act as a welcoming party with cherry and raspberry scents sitting in reserve. The palate is herbal but fairly fruity with fresh acidity and a solid if not the most deep and lasting finish. Despite showing some typical leafy qualities this is good young Carmenère.,Chile,Carmenère
Starts with a clean cherry and berry nose which sets up the fresh well-layered palate. Flavors of red fruits are ripe and medium sweet while touches of oak butter and pepper emerge on the finish. A tasty everyday wine.,Chile,Merlot
Generic berry aromas come in front of a medium-bodied palate with modest acidic chop. Cassis raspberry and plum flavors are supported by a dash of chocolate while that chocolaty character grows on a mildly spicy moderately complex finish.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Gritty aromas of charred beef and tar lead to a tight drawing palate with hard tannins. Balsamic flavors of roasted plum blackberry and green herbs finish tight grating and with residual tannic bite. If you know Chilean Carmenère this fits the mold.,Chile,Carmenère
Although this Syrah-led blend is earthy roasted and slightly rustic-smelling with dried berry aromas it is lively in the mouth with good acidity. Flavors of cherry cassis and plum finish round and healthy with weight and concentration but also lift. Drink through 2020.,Chile,Red Blend
Muscular rubbery aromas of black fruits are minty and tough. On the palate this is rough as nails with pounding tannins. Lead flavors of coconut vanilla and chocolate are oak based while the finish keeps that profile going. This is a big dark oaky wine with generic black-fruit character.,Chile,Merlot
Pungent pure aromas of citrus and tarragon are appealing. This feels upright and tangy with bright driving acidity. Grapefruit lime and jalapeño flavors finish juicy with leftover citrus notes and a dash of white pepper.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Lime and green-apple aromas are tight and stony. Bright juicy and chiseled on the palate this tastes of wet stones lime and bell pepper. Citrusy residual flavors along with a note of bitter citrus pith make for an honest finish.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Reduced on the nose with blueberry boysenberry and syrupy aromas that reflect the 55% Malbec in this Malbec-CS-Syrah blend. The palate is rich but flat with dark flavors of black fruits blueberrry and black licorice. Chunky and a little off the grid but still good for a bulky wine.,Chile,Red Blend
Earth olive blackberry and licorice are the key aromas on this Merlot-led blend that includes Cab Sauvignon Syrah and Carmenère. The palate is a bit heavy and heady and the tannins bite. But the roasted blackberry and herbal flavors work well and you can't complain about the wine's density.,Chile,Red Blend
Fleshy melony aromas cuddle some fresh oak. The palate has decent acidity so there's freshness along with weight resiny oak flavors lemon and green apple. Zesty and citrusy on the finish with a dash of vanilla.,Chile,Chardonnay
Classic Carmenère aromas of spiced blackberry olive herbs and cola hint at green but in the mouth this warm-vintage wine is ripe lush and layered with resiny oak. Flavors of cola vanilla blackberry and black cherry are nicely herbal while a spicy finish brings char and coffee notes along with plush weight. Drink through 2018.,Chile,Carmenère
In the three vintages we've tasted this blend of Cabernet Franc Cab Sauvignon and Carmenère it has never slipped below 90 points. This 2005 version is the best yet; it has fine oak up front with fresh berry aromas lurking below. The palate is sly sexy and whole with flavors of plum cassis and leather. Secure on the finish and overall there are no faults to be found. Drink now or hold for another couple of years.,Chile,Red Blend
Is this the best Cabernet that Viu Manent has ever bottled? We think it very well might be; the wine is midnight madness meaning it's dark as night and richly draped with blackberry cassis black plum and overall lushness. It's a hulk of a wine with jammy fruit fine tannic structure and handsome shadings. Drinkable now and probably better over the next two or three years.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Candied berry and cotton candy aromas include creamy notes of oak and vanilla. A beefy muscular palate gives dark flavors of blackberry and chocolate while peppery spice and burnt notes rise up on a spunky finish.,Chile,Malbec
It's been a while since Torres Chile has made a Chardonnay this good. Minerally and toasty is the best way to describe this structured white. Good acidity keeps it upright while plenty of barrel cinnamon apple and lemon character give it a Burgundian leaning. This is woody racy and very lively now. Drink in 2014–15.,Chile,Chardonnay
Nice aromas of smoked meat coconut dried berry fruit and pepper set up a nice palate of concentrated snappy raspberry and plum flavors. Clean mildly herbal nicely spiced and with good mouthfeel and follow through. Shows the mildest touch of creamy oak flavor.,Chile,Shiraz
Made in a mild ripasso style this wine is miserly on the nose and hot on the finish but what comes in between is very nice. Sweet flavors of brandied cherries plum and chocolate blend with spice and pepper accents as it rolls forcefully across the palate. As said it burns late something that may resolve with bottle age. Drink now through 2011.,Chile,Carmenère
Tamaya seems to have turned the corner with its 2008 Cabs (the reserva is also very good). This wine is condensed and concentrated with blackberry jam and other sweet berry aromas. The palate is pure and tastes of cassis and black fruit while the finish has cola notes and a slight tannic bite. Generous for the price. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company LLC.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Tight angular aromas of cranberry red plum crushed mineral and dried leaves lead to a tough palate with black fruit flavors led by prune. A very concentrated powerful wine based on Carignan and Syrah with lemony oak and pounding tannins. Should be more tame by now; hold another year or two and keep your fingers crossed.,Chile,Red Blend
When people talk about good value Cabs from Chile this is what they should be referring to. The nose is balanced and offers plenty of clean berry aromas while the palate is fresh light in weight and mildly citrusy with flavors of cassis plum and raspberry. More snappy and fresh than weighty.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Oaky deep berry aromas are slightly citric and stalky. In the mouth huge tannins create a grating but mouthfilling sensation. Herbal lightly green flavors of cassis boysenberry carob and salted beef finish strong and solid. Drink through 2019.,Chile,Malbec
Earth leather and tarry berry aromas yield to a fresh forceful palate with power and balance. Spicy plum and berry flavors are a touch herbal and pointed while a peppery woody spicy finish is leathery hot and scratchy. Drink through 2018.,Chile,Carmenère
Deep woody leathery aromas of blackberry and baked plum set up a dense palate that's a touch heavy with buttery oak notes. Herbal berry pepper and graphite flavors are woody and finish with notes of green herbs mint leaf and chocolate.,Chile,Syrah
One of Chile's best red blends is back with a vengeance. The nose is a wonderful mix of almond candy fine leather baked pastry prune and licorice all bundled up in a comfortable blanket while the palate is mouthfilling and loaded with cassis coffee herbs and pepper flavors. Excellent structure and depth with power and balance. Drinkable now but ageable through 2014.,Chile,Cabernet Blend
Rooty aromas of baking spices and black fruits are restrained and delicate on the nose. This is full round and mildly tannic with baked plum berry spice and peppery flavors. Toast nutmeg and bright acidity carry the finish on this blend of 71% Carmenère with additions of Cabernet Sauvignon Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Drink through 2017.,Chile,Carmenère
For what's supposed to be an upper-level wine this is prickly and clipped. The nose is herbal and spicy with limited red-fruit notes. The palate is driven by racy acids and peppery herbal flavors on top of tart red plum. Overall there's not much fruit to this crisp sizzler.,Chile,Carmenère
The bouquet on this Cab is pretty good with red-fruit aromas suggestive of plums. The palate is basic with semisweet red-berry flavors that support the wine's “medium dry” designation. Things run mellow but steady on what amounts to a short simple finish.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Spicy plum and cherry pie aromas offer a note of vanilla before falling off. In the mouth this is wiry and drawing with citric acids pushing raspberry and herbal plum flavors toward rawness. The finish is snappy on the surface but hollow beyond that.,Chile,Carmenère
This hard snappy Cab is granular and tough on the nose an indicator of what's to come. The palate is edgy and tight as nails with herbal plum flavors that land on a spicy lightly green finish. 2011 was a very cool vintage in Chile and this reflects that.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
With a bouquet of dark plum and toasty oak with an earthy barnyardy note this wine from this older Bordeaux grape still cultivated in Chile has medium weight and some plum and caramel flavors. In the end the wood is a bit much for the fruit and it is not dissimilar to some Barberas from Italy's Piedmont that wear an overweight of oak.,Chile,Carmenère
With 19% Cabernet Sauvignon this is a deeply flavored youthful wine precocious and sharp with acidity and fresh as newly crushed grapes. The dominant fruits are blackberries and plums with a hint of bitter chocolate. The tannins are soft and creamy. It's a bit rough around the edges but is well made and gets the job done.,Chile,Merlot
Attractive and correct berry plum and cocoa aromas open to a plummy palate with a round mouthfeel. The cocoa and toast finish has easy tannins. Has all the right elements but in a rather simple expression wanting intensity.,Chile,Merlot
A pleasant and cleanly made quaffing wine with plenty of berry and black-cherry fruit and a strong menthol streak running right through to the finish. A bit rough around the edges; might show better with a country-style dish of stewed chicken.,Chile,Merlot
A run-of-the-mill Cabernet Sauvignon it's all up front. There are nice cassis aromatics but little on the palate. The finish is short and vegetal.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Everything is front-end in this Chardonnay. The nose has plenty of tropical fruit and with some toasted oak in the background. Decent acidity supports the fruit and the smooth mouthfeel is pleasing but the wine cuts off abruptly with a somewhat short resinous close.,Chile,Chardonnay
This wine like so many from the 1998 vintage in Chile is very light in texture and displays little depth. The flavors are accurate for a claret—mild berry and a touch of earth—and there's even a decent finish. A light quaff; don't expect weight.,Chile,Red Blend
Orangey aromas wrapped in not very subtle oak open this light-to-medium weight wine. Simple and a bit one-dimensional it offers light pear flavors and a dry finish. Acceptable as an easy quaff but not the stuff worthy of reserve designation.,Chile,Chardonnay
Red-berry fruit with a heavy dose of herb and bell pepper marks this red blend. The mouthfeel is smooth but the acidity is high and the wine finishes slightly tart with a green note. Another victim of this tough year. (We'll look forward to the 1999.),Chile,Red Blend
Lots of cedar is evident on the nose and palate of this red blend. The berry and cassis aromas and flavors are a bit hard to discern and also bear a too-prominent minty slightly herbaceousness. This medium weight wine closes with a dry tart woodiness that lacks mass appeal.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
Offers varietally correct flavors of black currants and hints of tobacco but where's the structure and depth? A simple fruity red for early drinking that would make a decent picnic wine or bar pour.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Juicy dark cherry and berry aromas with cedar and cola notes present a Pinot Noir like profile for this wine. It continues the disguise with its cherry and oak flavors rather light mouthfeel and lack of density for a Cabernet based wine.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
This light to medium weight Cabernet has the right profile but just doesn't seem to come alive. The nose shows blackberry and tobacco aromas and in the mouth there are dried black cherry and spice notes but they never shine. A soflty dry slightly woody finish closes the package.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Basic Cabernet Sauvignon with all its goods up front. Opens with some nice cassis aromatics but there’s just not much on the palate. The finish is short and there’s a greenness to the fruit that reflects the tremendous difficulty of the 1998 vintage. Not up to previous efforts.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
It's nice to see an ever-increasing number of serviceable kosher wines like this one being made available to consumers from around the world. That said this one isn't much more than adequate. There's a modest amount of cassis fruit dressed up with earthy chocolate and vaguely minty aromas but it lacks depth. Still it's better than the kosher stuff I remember from my friends' bar mitzvahs.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
With a vegetal note some cocoa and berry on the nose and its simple rather flat flavor profile this Cabernet suffers from both vintage deficiencies and over-oaking. Dry and woody on the back end.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Strawberry and pink grapefruit aromas mingle enticingly on the nose. But on the palate it seems a bit syrupy and heavy finishing with a touch of cola.,Chile,Rosé
A light and tart wine with a bouquet of berry tea and a touch of barnyard. On the palate there's more cherry tea and oak. The fundamental Pinot characteristics are here but it turns drying and a bit sour on the finish.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Wearing a heavy mantle of rather green not-too-subtle oak the fruit in this wine struggles to be noticed. Faintly apple with earthy notes it is fairly buried and the wine lacks the life and dimension on the palate one seeks in a wine with reserve status.,Chile,Chardonnay
An attractive bouquet of pear orange-lime and floral notes opens this easy round white. There's a hint of mint and plenty of citrus on the palate but the fruit is touch too sweet low acid and the mouthfeel a bit fat. Lacks the spine we'd like to see in a top Riesling.,Chile,Riesling
The pineapple and lemon aromas and flavors in this wine just seem to lack the spark to make them come alive. There's a medium texture on the palate but the subdued uninspired quality extends to the mouthfeel as well. A reserve label deserves more substance.,Chile,Chardonnay
Initial aromas of corn chips and banana mix in toast and vanilla. The palate is more direct and fruity with baked apple and lemony flavors sharing time with sweet resiny oak. Vanilla and later bitterness carry the finish. A wine that shows better in the mouth than on the nose.,Chile,Chardonnay
Salinic and pungent with celery green citrus and nettle aromas. This is pure SB although it's not 100% SB because Secreto always has a little something else in the blend. Fresh acidic and alive with lime and slightly pickled accents to the finish.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Fresh asparagus green bean lime and mineral make for a textbook coastal Chilean SB nose. The palate is fresh crisp clear and lean with zesty lemon-lime lettuce asparagus and tangerine flavors. Long and lasting on the finish with a spot of sweetness at the end.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
A natural wine made from four grapes. The nose has an abundance of black fruit along with leather and dried herb notes while the palate although a bit hard and acidic is also pretty well saturated. Grapey generous and flavorful but a little rough in the mouth.,Chile,Red Blend
On first take this smells a bit vegetal and chemical but time and air clean it up. Racy tight and lean on the palate this tastes of tart green fruits lime and green apple in particular. A slightly broken yeasty finish suggests early-stage oxidation.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Woody aromas of oak grain blend with scented candle wax and briny stone-fruit notes. This feels chunky yet high in malic acid. Salty flavors of popcorn and apple cider carry a strong barrel influence while this finishes with resiny oak and briny white-fruit flavors.,Chile,Chardonnay
Dark in color with aromas of road tar blackberry and burnt toast. The palate has good life and snap to it with flavors of black cherry plum chocolaty oak and a dash of cough medicine. Solid and scouring on the finish with vanilla to soften things up. Regular but good value.,Chile,Merlot
Despite a persistent front-to-back sweetness this is a nice little Chardonnay for those fastened to the grape. It starts with ripe pineapple and apple aromas and next you get tropical fruit citrus and banana flavors. Medium in size and good for what it strives to be.,Chile,Chardonnay
This dark-hued Cab is piquant and herbal on the nose with power eucalyptus aromas and a spot of cheesy oak. The mouthfeel is good while flavors of oak herbs and plum set up a lightly green finish. This tastes and smells like a good Cab from a chilly year.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
This SB opens with melony aromas along with green spunky notes. At first it's chunky and grabby feeling and then it flattens out a bit. Flavors of scallion bell pepper and citrus end mildly bitter with some heat and burn.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Meaty tarry aromas get reduced to simple darkness and shoe polish as this Merlot opens. A full-bodied palate is home to oaky minty chocolaty flavors of generic berry and herbal flavors. A crisp finish is nothing but ordinary.,Chile,Merlot
Herbal aromas of olive and sweaty leather require patience. In the mouth this is firm and acidic with a spiky feel and peppery flavors of mint and spice that outmuscle the wine's fruit component. A dry acid-driven finish is the close.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Earthy tarry gritty aromas come with generous black-fruit scents. This is bold bright and lively in character with juicy acidity creating a racy pulse. Spice licorice plum and tomato flavors finish fresh and elegant with clarity and length. Drink through 2017.,Chile,Syrah
Smells clipped tough and oily with a hardness to the bouquet. The palate is fleshy and wet with reasonably fresh melon and papaya flavors. Finishes pithy and slightly bitter and overall it's barely a good wine on its best day.,Chile,Chardonnay
Neutral on the nose to the point of dull and mute. The palate is more wet than complex and the flavors of apple candy and toffee are basic at best. For a half-bottle priced at $25 this is underwhelming and far too simple in all facets.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Brambly with a mild vineagary sourness to the nose. The palate is tart crisp and scratchy with sweet-and-sour flavors of plum herbs and even grass. Finishes green and challenged. Kind of weak for $17.,Chile,Merlot
Hard acrid and sweaty smelling with a plump but dilute-feeling palate that shows flavors of bitter peach pit white grapefruit and citrus. Hard and bitter on the finish. Harmony is questionable; overall quality is sketchy.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Short on aromatics with only a whiff of pear and corn. The palate is soft and fleshy with dry limited papaya and melony flavors. Lettuce and other green notes carry the finish which is bland and dilute. Will have a very short lifespan.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Vegetal on first blush with aromas of green bean and asparagus. The green character becomes less obvious with time but there's still a bell pepper element to the palate which offers mildly stewy flavors. Finishes bland and as a whole it's not exactly cutting the mustard.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Gritty minerally aromas of vitamins and medicinal plum and cranberry set up a full-bodied palate with creamy oak. Herbal spicy black-plum flavors finish oaky and a bit sticky and heavy.,Chile,Pinot Noir

This features plum berry and leather aromas that are accented by a hint of lemon. It feels narrow and drawing with black fruit herb and carob flavors. The finish which doesn't taste green or herbal is better and wider.,Chile,Carmenère
Popcorn sweet melon and pear aromas dominate the nose. This feels pure and chunky with honeyed melon apple and spiced peach flavors. Fruity thick and tropical in style this is not too serious but not bad either.,Chile,Chardonnay
This is mild and lightly citric smelling with an ocean spray note on the bouquet. On the palate it is fresh and deep with a note of nectarine. The finish is solid but loses some fruit and gains some bitterness.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Candied but also peppery and herbal and without much depth or complexity. The palate is tight acidic sheering and tastes of snappy edgy cherry and raspberry fruit. Then an oaky vanilla dryness sets in. Solid and fresh but hardly a head-turner.,Chile,Merlot
Silly name and label but not a bad wine. The nose is meaty medicinal and fails to hold its form over extended airing but early on it's good and honest as is the palate of herbal tomato and cassis flavors. A little bit scrappy but for $10 it's better than most.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Fresh and green-fruited with mildly sweet talcum powder aromas. Turns more stark in the mouth and toward sour apple and grapefruit. Fairly acidic and thus more zesty than substantive. Lemony and sharp on the finish.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Roasted leafy aromas greet you followed by familiar scents of cherry and plum. The body is light to medium with citric acidity turning the raspberry and pie cherry palate in the direction of snappy. Lithe on the finish with a quick fade-away.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Tropical in style which for Los Vascos is as expected. Year after year this Casablanca Chardonnay tastes smells and seems more like Sauvignon Blanc than Chardonnay. As per usual it's spunky citric green and grapefruity. A breed unto itself with a zesty green character.,Chile,Chardonnay
Opens with aromas of black cherry pepper herbs and rubber. The palate is sort of flat and low in intensity with smooth but basic flavors of vanilla and berry compote. Tastes sort of roasted and minty on the finish but also full and sweet.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon

Tropical fruit air freshener and bath soap aromas lead to a candied sticky palate with a mix of sweet flavors that include papaya powdered sugar and mango. The finish is confected and soft.,Chile,Chardonnay

This is flat oily and waxy on the nose which indicates that this 2010 offering is past its prime. Melony flavors are soft and bready and the feel is flabby and on its way to expiring.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
From every angle this wine is sharp raspy and brambly. The mouthfeel is scratchy while the flavors waver between being burnt and stalky to being shrill and sour. Char and compost elements bring down the finish.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
The nose is bland becoming vegetal and dull on the palate with green bean and bell pepper flavors that are more normal for underripe Sauvignon Blanc than Chardonnay. This finishes pithy and green.,Chile,Chardonnay
This wine is made from fruit that was sourced from very close to the Pacific Ocean. As a result it's ultragreen and vegetal on the nose with a palate that bears high acid and a flavor of citrus extract plus touches of beans and peas.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
This is raw sour tangy and loaded with juniper and pine notes.,Chile,Pinot Noir

Grassy aromas include notes of corn and apple. This feels fresh and citric with moderate roundness. Salty citrus and kiwi flavors are lasting on a crisp juicy finish.,Chile,Chardonnay
This Sauvignon Blanc looks only slightly more colorful than a glass of water. On the nose it's crisp and green while sharp acidity matched against a light body makes for a lean palate. Crisp salty citric flavors finish tight and linear.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Cheesy aromas of leather licorice and black fruits filter into a jagged fiercely tannic palate. Flavors of tea black plum stewed berry and herbs finish with a big residual tannic bite.,Chile,Petite Sirah
Pickled briny aromas of canned vegetables are common for this wine and Casa Marin. On the palate high acidity sticks out and lends an iron grip to this original coastal SB. A mix of citrus and vegetal flavors include notes of pumpkin and pickled beans.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
A fierce nose displays strong notes of pyrazines making this more love-it-or-leave-it than mainstream. Chunky on the palate with a bit of flabby weight it tastes of briny citrus jalapeño and bell pepper. This is within the norms for Chilean SB but it might be too green and bitter for some palates.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Dry peppery currant and red-plum aromas are light and nothing you haven't come across before. Plum flavors are a touch baked with a chocolaty backdrop. A solid finish with savory spicy plum notes is satisfying.,Chile,Merlot
Generic but solid aromas of cassis and rubber lead to a basic palate with plum currant spice and herbal flavors. Drying tannins a touch of toast and good overall balance define the finish.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Although this is slightly raisiny on the nose and thus plump chunky and stewed in feel the wine's cassis prune and fig flavors settle well and finish with notes of black plum and chocolate. For value-priced boxed wine this is perfectly good.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Dry earthy spicy aromas of currant and red plum lead to a palate that's high in acidity and almost scouring. Tart borderline sour plum and currant flavors finish crisp but stripped.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Plum blackberry and boysenberry aromas show nuances of citrus peel and rubber band. On the palate this is tight mildly tannic and slightly astringent due to firm tannins. A mix of ripe blackberry and cassis flavors come with chocolaty oak in front of a hard-pushing lightly herbal finish. Drink through 2018.,Chile,Merlot
Perfumed and floral on the nose but also spicy and slightly foresty which is apropos for Syrah. Flavors of black olive brandied cherry and blackberry are perfectly nice and the feel is mildly creamy and rich but still pointed. Finishes with toasty notes of pepper brown sugar and woodspice.,Chile,Syrah
A little rubbery at first but then it unfolds with floral blackberry and tar aromas. Fairly dynamic in terms of feel with elevated red-fruit flavors balanced by oak and chocolate. Firm and peppery on the back end with lasting notes of cassis. For $15 this is pretty fine Cabernet. Imported by Republic National Distributors.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Band-Aid and baked red-fruit aromas set up a plump palate with creaminess. Candied smoky-berry flavors finish oaky and toasty with enough true PN character to make this worthwhile.,Chile,Pinot Noir
This is another take-it-or-leave-it version of Lot 5. As per usual it's an intense example of Leyda Valley Chardonnay which means it's super briny and barely ripe. Blazing acidity creates a sense of sharpness while saline-rich flavors of citrus and oak finish racy in that patented Chilean coastal way.,Chile,Chardonnay
Briny aromas of citrus and chlorinated pool water dominate the nose. Flavors of corn and briny stone fruits are pushed by strong acidity on the finish. Otherwise there's little else on offer.,Chile,Chardonnay

Light on the nose then fresh but a bit watery on the palate this simple SB delivers undefined citrus flavors that lose steam in front of a quiet finish.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc

On the nose this Carmenère is integrated and earthy with cedar black cherry baked plum and spice aromas. The palate is a touch abrasive and edgy while core blackberry flavors are surrounded by oak chocolate and earth notes. A long woody persistent finish is mildly complex. Drink through 2019.,Chile,Carmenère
Foxy berry and currant flavors carry a note of wet dog fur. This is clampy and saucy feeling on the palate with herbal flavors of plum berry and tomato sauce. A hollow finish tastes slightly green.,Chile,Merlot
Harsh rubbery black-fruit aromas include notes of mushroom and horseradish. A shallow palate with hard tannins doesn't offer much space for a soft landing. It tastes largely of hickory on a choppy finish.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Vegetal aromas of canned peas are also oddly powdery. This feels racy and healthy but flavors of canned veggies echo the nose. A salty green-tasting peppery finish yields little to no fruit.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Dark aromas of tire rubber forest and juniper are lead elements on the nose. This Syrah is astringent with rawness to the palate. There's a sense of grape skins to the black-fruit flavor profile and the tone just seems a little off.,Chile,Syrah
Saucy tomato and herbal berry aromas are a bit green. This feels creamy and thick but also bumpy. Oaky herbal black-fruit flavors are a touch stewy. It tastes green minty and herbal on the finish.,Chile,Merlot
This amounts to a flabby basic SB from a hot vintage. The nose is dull and lacks spunk. The palate is soft and fleshy with bitter-leaning bland flavors of melon mild citrus and white pepper.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Lapostolle makes many excellent wines and quite a few good values; this Sauvignon Blanc from the warm Rapel Valley is not one of them. Like in prior years this is bland and fleshy with soft wide dull flavors of melon and sweet apple. And it's weak on acidity. 60000 cases made.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
There's no shortage of funky wildness to the nose: leather juniper and rubbery berry scents are all accounted for. The palate carries minimal tannic grip while flavors of herbal berry fruits rekindle the juniper from the nose leaving an herbal aftertaste.,Chile,Shiraz

While this smells plump mealy and soft it's decidedly acidic and citrusy in the mouth. In terms of feel it's limited and monotone while the flavors run toward vanilla orange and oak. The finish is fleeting finish and light on flavor.,Chile,Chardonnay

Sweet on the nose with a lot of mocha vanilla and candied fruit. The palate is tannic and very oaky for a wine of this level. Flavors of toffee cocoa mocha and generic berry fruit show more oak than purity. A good wine but heavy handed with the oak. Contains 15% Syrah.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Pungent aromas of asparagus sea grass and lime are pure Leyda and while the wine seems to be softening with age it does offer enough acids to keep it moving. Flavors of lime and green bean are green in nature and there's seltzer and more lime on the finish. May already be past its sell date.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Opens with honey orange and a bit of harsh matchstick. The palate is sticky and comes up just short of cloying with candied melon citrus and mango flavors. Finishes sweet and sugary with caramel and toffee notes. Tasty but unctuous.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Valdivieso's nonvintage mystery blend is always one of Chile's most curious wines and #16 happens to be superb. An opening of rich black-cherry aromas tips towards spice cake with raisins. A lush saturated palate holds delicious flavors of chocolaty black fruits while on the finish a dark smokiness takes over. Drink now–2023.,Chile,Red Blend
This is an honest wine with an herbal aroma and notes of tomato and red plum. It feels zingy due to tomato-like acidity with red fruit flavors followed by a lean finish.,Chile,Carmenère

Innocuous on the nose with hints of mild oak and white fruit this feels zesty and lean with citrus and melon flavors. It's mellow sweet and easy.,Chile,Chardonnay

This smells dry and leafy with a bacon note. It feels lively and edgy with berry currant and oak spice in its flavor profile. It finishes fairly tannic and warm with a rubbery strength.,Chile,Carmenère

There's no shortage of black-fruit aromas on the nose. However the palate is bumpy and jagged in feel with hard-driving black currant wild blackberry and licorice flavors. A shearing finish with punchy acidity is not congruent with the rest of the wine.,Chile,Malbec
Apple and pear aromas set up a lively somewhat chunky feeling palate. Flavors of green citrus fruits and brine finish similarly with briny notes sitting side by side with citrus flavors.,Chile,Chardonnay
This single-vineyard Malbec may come from a young vineyard (planted in 2000) but it's still dark concentrated and masculine. Purple in color with thick grapey aromas that lead to lush blackberry cola and chocolate flavors. Rich deep and well developed for Chilean Malbec.,Chile,Malbec
A powerful dark and alluring specimen with chocolate olive paste road tar and blackberry aromas. The palate is tight rubbery tannic and fierce with juicy pumped-up boysenberry and dark plum flavors. Shows its varietal side meaning herbs and olive on the finish. Not spectacular but very good.,Chile,Carmenère

Right from the beginning this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend oozes old-school Chilean calling cards: The nose is full of eucalyptus and herbal berry aromas along with tobacco and spicy berry scents. A tannic heavy palate is hard and grinding while baked flavors of black fruits come with a reprise of herbaceous character. Drink through 2022.,Chile,Red Blend
From a warm vintage this Syrah is raisiny and jammy up front but more staunch and structured as it opens.

Drink through 2016.,Chile,Syrah

Given the price this is pretty good stuff. It's plush and offers enough body and ripe fruit to offset the fact that there isn't a whole lot of structure or backbone. For a soft tasty plum-and-herb style of Carmenère however it gets the job done.,Chile,Carmenère
On first take this small-batch blend of País and Cinsault is overtly oaky with earthy berry and plum notes lurking in the background. A drawing tannic palate lets you know that País is in the house while this tastes of oaky berry and plum. On the finish this is more resiny and woody than toasty. Only 235 cases made. Drink through 2021.,Chile,Red Blend
Earthy lightly herbal and stewed aromas of spiced plum prune and raisin lead to a grabby tannic somewhat abrasive palate. Given that this is now seven years past harvest it's interesting how ripped gritty and lively it feels. Herbal chunky flavors of spiced berry fruits and residual oak close with energy. Drink through 2022.,Chile,Carignan
Dusty citrusy aromas form the greeting while the palate is juicy in style without much definition beyond zestiness. The flavors offer notes of papaya and nectarine. The finish sizzles for a moment then fizzles.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc

Spunky and lightly herbal up front with exotic lightweight aromas. Feels snappy tight and lean in the mouth with bouncy red plum and pie cherry flavors. Shows good juiciness reasonably complex flavors and a dry spicy finish.,Chile,Pinot Noir
While this Cabernet Sauvignon-driven blend opens with fiery herbal aromas of plum and cherry time helps it along. A fairly raw and juicy palate is far from cushioned while herbal roasted flavors of plum and currant are spicy and fold in patented Chilean flavors of olive and herbs. Drink through 2020.,Chile,Red Blend
A little roasted and leafy smelling which is typical for base-level Chilean Merlot. The palate is sweet almost to the brink of being candied with plum and chocolate flavors running the show. Not much structure or tannic bite here but as a whole it's tasty and gets better as it opens up.,Chile,Merlot

Dry lean and sawdusted on the nose with vanilla aromas blending with simple plum and berry notes. Whole on the palate with a creamy mildly tacky feel while the flavors of red fruits are regular at best and smothered with butter and wood resin. Solid enough but probably too woody given the wine's weight and overall quality.,Chile,Merlot

Fresh light aromas of raspberry and milk chocolate give the wine legitimacy but for the most part it's simply a lean sassy Pinot with racy red-fruit flavors warmth and a touch of sweet oak. Rudimentary but varietally correct with few flaws or virtues. Good but wholly basic.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Based on the number of 84s we've assigned to Aresti's Chardonnays over the years that seems to be where this winery has settled. This vintage is more of the same: it's light lemony and salinic with flavors of green melon grapefruit and lettuce. A little dilute on the finish but decent as a whole.,Chile,Chardonnay

Citrus and salad-like aromas are more subdued and neutral than punchy. This feels melony and lower than normal on zestiness. Flavors of green fruits and mild herbs finish mellow and slightly bitter.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc

Give it air time and it'll give back floral raspberry and cherry aromas in front of a racy forward-style palate that's got cherry and red plum flavors and integrated spice.

This one has bland aromatics with only a touch of oak to grasp at. The palate is almost spritzy which it shouldn't be and the flavor resembles Mott's applesauce. A bit weak and only qualifies for an acceptable rating on its best day.,Chile,Chardonnay
The nose is sulphuric and a bit barnyardy which screams“watch out” but in the mouth there's acceptable if unspectacular apple fruit. It's scratchy in the finish and probably just this side of not being worth drinking.,Chile,Chardonnay

Gritty uric green aromas come in front of a round palate with little cut. Vegetal bitter flavors of bell pepper and grapefruit finish with another wave of bitterness.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Heavy raisiny aromas of cherry and chocolate are ominous. This feels thick out of shape and awkward with zero elegance. Weedy raisiny syrupy berry flavors finish fat with a palpable note of cooked fruit.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Green soupy aromas of tomato are blatant and harsh. This is decent in terms of mouthfeel but it reverts to herbaceous leafy flavors of bell pepper and grass that finish with nothing but pyrazines.,Chile,Merlot
Aromas of mushroom dirty water and mud puddle are far from inviting. Herbal briny flavors of mushroom salt and bitterness come with almost no fruit.,Chile,Malbec
Almost neutral on the nose an herbal arugula element finally emerges. The palate is light and crisp with a bitter aftertaste.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
This has overripe tropical-fruit aromas on the nose. Wheaty oxidized flavors finish with a note of mushy fruit.,Chile,Chardonnay
This is a spicy number with a minty green aroma along with cherry molasses and smoke notes. The mouthfeel is edgy and lively while the flavors of vanilla cocoa and herbal plum and berry are solid and composed. It's solid but a bit herbal on the finish.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Candied white-fruit aromas are generic and rudimentary. This feels flat and doesn't show much life on the palate. Flavors of canned pear oak and related spice finish bland.,Chile,Chardonnay
While the nose is pungent and true to the variety there isn't much else positive to say about this cypher of a Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is plump yet fizzy while the flavor profile offers citrus bitterness and nothing more.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Mellow and floral on the nose this turns loud and aggressive in the mouth. Candied lime and mango flavors finish rugged and screaming.,Chile,Chardonnay
With little varietal character on the nose this qualifies as a basic plump white wine with mild fruit oily notes and some bitterness.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Odd aromas of pomegranate and grapefruit are off the grid. This is citric and austere in feel with sour herbal flavors mixed with oak. A minty herbal green finish raises questions.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Light and tropical on the nose this is flabby on the palate and tastes dull and sweet with a creamy aftertaste and low acidity.,Chile,Chardonnay
This perenially mediocre wine is a little worse in 2012. It smells blowsy floral and strange while in the mouth it's like oaky apple cider. Flavors of cider and faux oak are less than impressive as is the overall balance.,Chile,Chardonnay
If the blend of Riesling and Sauvignon Blanc isn't jarring enough then the wine's combination of high acid and heavy oak should be. This smells like plywood and sawdust while the palate is both racy and resiny. Oaky toasty bitter flavors of lemon and underripe nectarine hold onto a barrel-driven flavors on the finish.,Chile,White Blend
Cherry and berry aromas are a bit hot and saucy. This feels chunky and borderline sticky with hard raspberry and plum flavors. This is marginal even for basic commercial Cabernet.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Briary herbal berry aromas take on a wet-dog scent. This feels shear and shrill with high acidity and not much body. Sour black-plum flavors are highly herbal and borderline weedy while a tart scouring finish closes this out.,Chile,Malbec
Stalky damp funky aromas are not unusual for Elqui wines. This is mild in feel and registers as being in the Pinot Noir range. Rooty bitter flavors are rustic and low on fruit. Heat on the finish is of no help.,Chile,Pinot Noir
Bland pithy citrus aromas come with notes of saline solution and pool water. This is 85% Viognier and 15% Chardonnay and the body is plump but vague. Flavors of papaya and pickle juice finish green briny and melony.,Chile,White Blend
Earthy leathery berry and mushroom aromas don't stir much interest. This feels tannic and heavy while flavors of baked berry fruits and caramel finish hot and rugged.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Blatant aromas of popcorn don't allow for much fruit expression on the nose. This is heavy and lacking in vitality. Flavors of toast burnt wood barrel resin and tropical fruits finish soft.,Chile,Chardonnay
Red-berry aromas are damp mulchy and not fully fresh. On the palate this wine feels sticky while flavors of briny herbal red-berry fruits turn salty on the finish.,Chile,Pinot Noir
There's nothing too tricky about this dilute mealy smelling Sauvignon Blanc that's blended with 10% Carmenère for a reason we can't explain. With drawing white-grape tannins this tastes green and citrusy with a scallion note to the finish.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Aromas of orange and tangerine are oily on the nose. Melon papaya and almond-skin flavors end with creamy lees notes that give way to bitterness on a dilute finish.,Chile,Pedro Ximénez
This opens like an exploding hand grenade filled with pyrazines and jalapeño extract. The narrow acidic palate is lacking in depth but at least it's fresh. Briny green flavors of jalapeño and bell peppers never let go while the finish is tart and green with a lasting note of bell pepper.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Plum and berry aromas come with a floral accent. This feels raw and a touch abrasive with woody saucy flavors of berry fruits and plum. The oaky heavily spiced finish brings a grippy tannic feel.,Chile,Carmenère
Tarry black-cherry aromas are a bit damp oaky and scratchy but overall this opens well. A solid firm edgy palate offers flavors of herbal blackberry and baked black plum while the finish is meaty and a touch salty.,Chile,Merlot
Grapy berry and raisin aromas include notes of baking spices. This feels wide but wiry with tartaric acidity at the core. Generic berry flavors end with a dry drawing finish.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Bright but basic plum spice and leather aromas are uncomplicated. This feels grabby and rugged with chewy tannins. Leafy red-fruit flavors offer a jammy side note while this finishes with dry scouring tannins.,Chile,Syrah
Cool-climate pyrazinic aromas are punchy and feline. This feels good but weaker and more dilute than in most years. Briny pickled citrus flavors follow the nose while this ends lean and green but solid enough.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Grassy slightly green aromas are fresh and suggest cactus pad. This is easy on the palate with flavors of citrus fruits and green herbs such as tarragon and rosemary. A crisp finish is just solid enough to maintain integrity.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Spiced plum vanilla and sandalwood aromas add up to something nice. This feels good enough with nothing demanding about the palate. Spicy berry and olive flavors are typical of the variety while this feels dry and tastes a bit woody on the finish.,Chile,Carmenère
Lanolin and squash aromas indicate that this is fading. The palate is wide and fleshy but lacking in a focal point. Flavors of spiced pumpkin and aged apple are a bit like holiday pie while modest acidity on the finish ensures that this is bland on the exit.,Chile,Chardonnay
Heavy oak on the nose means aromas of pencil lead wet cement and blacktop are in the lead. This wine feels resiny and tannic with a similar woody flavor accenting herbal black fruit. Although this is a good Cabernet it's quite oaky.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Very sweet and lush on the nose and teetering on overripe due to prune and raisin aromas. The palate meanwhile is more narrow than you might expect with big tannins and extract. Tastes of black plum blackberry and herbal notes. A ripe loud wine that's a little clumsy but definitely big and fruity. 200 cases made.,Chile,Malbec
Smells like an ocean breeze mixed with field greens citrus and passion fruit. Montes has been a leader in Chile's movement toward coastal SB and this one is blasting with grapefruit green apple passion fruit and minerality. In the mouth it has some weight and richness; but that's balanced by zippy acidity. Can't imagine a better match for ceviche or tuna tartare.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Dark as night with aromas of brick dust kirsch and black fruit. Don't expect anything like French Cab Franc from this Chilean monster. It's huge and fully directed toward blackberry and cassis. Which means the herbal leafy tobacco notes common to CF are simply not present here. But if you like yours big and burly with crusty dark fruit then this is your ticket.,Chile,Cabernet Franc
The best Don Max in quite some time. After too many herbal-green vintages the 2005 is ripe rich and well woven. The bouquet shows hickory roasted plum chocolate vanilla and peanut. The palate meanwhile is all about pure cassis blackberry mocha and spice. Finishes with a dash of caramel and earthy fruit leftovers. Honest rugged and ready but ageable for at least another 3–4 years.,Chile,Red Blend
At over $20 the brand's Best Buy days are behind it but this Cabernet still unfolds in serious but elegant form. The nose is dusty and dark with cassis and blackberry aromas. Meanwhile the feel is juicy and fresh and the palate is just sizable enough. Flavors of cassis chocolate and coconut are modern and friendly while the finish of cocoa mocha and marmalade is exciting.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Few $20 Cabs from anywhere are going to deliver like Medalla Real does. From first impressions which include aromas of toast coffee prune and devilish berry you know it's a good one. The feel is generous and the balance spot on so the plum berry coffee and chocolate flavors have structure and support. A complete wine with length mint and lavish tannins.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Rich chocolaty toasty aromas of lactic oak and vanilla match red-fruit scents of raspberry and strawberry. This is lively on the palate with an acidic pulse. Flavors of raw oak creamy vanilla plum and boysenberry finish overtly woody with a lasting flavor of oak grain. Drink through 2018.,Chile,Carignan

Tastes of powerful cassis and blackberry and shows concentration. Finishes thick smooth and a touch syrupy. Drink now through 2014.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
A little lean and fiery from nose to tail but amid all the heavyweights coming from Chile that might be a good thing.

This Merlot gets going with scratchy berry and plum aromas that come alongside roasted overtones. Choppy and tannic on the palate this is short on flavors with baked loamy berry notes leading to a lightly herbal briny tasting finish.,Chile,Merlot
Humo Blanco means “white smoke” and the name applies to the daily morning fog that spreads over the Lolol area where this comes from. Leathery earthy aromas of cherry and plum are ripe while the palate is tannic and rubbery. Earthy cherry and plum flavors finish lasting and potent.,Chile,Pinot Noir
With yeasty aromas of Animal Crackers vanilla and pear this is more warm soft and sweet than in the past. The year's warm characteristics are draped all over the palate which is soft and wide. Flavors of creamy white fruits and vanilla finish with lychee and grapefruit. This lacks some spine and vivacity but will be good through the end of the year.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
This earthy concentrated Malbec is dense on the nose with herbal flavors of blackberry spice and heat. A toasty finish carries a choppy feel and fresh acidity while the finish tastes toasty but doesn't rise up or improve. Overall this is perfectly good but not complex. Drink now.,Chile,Malbec

This light-colored almost clear SB opens with pungent fairly sharp aromas of sea brine and sweaty citrus fruits. In the mouth this is tight edgy and pointy due to blazing acidity. Citrus bell pepper and green-herb flavors finish peppery and with scouring acidity.,Chile,Sauvignon Blanc
Rubbery black-fruit aromas are heavily oaked so much so that this Cabernet-Carmenère blend smells charred but also like plastic. A big grabby palate is jagged in feel while this tastes like the nose suggests meaning oaky herbal and like berry fruits and plum. A woody finish is short on total integration.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère
Dusty raspberry and plum aromas show a note of Band-Aid. This feels creamy and full with black cherry chocolate and oak flavors. An oaky essence carries onto the finish which is chunky and lasting.,Chile,Pinot Noir

Setting a new high bar for Carmenère is this luxury version from Concha y Toro's Cachapoal vineyard. And while it deserves to be drunk sooner than later we recommend it for the best steak you grill this year. It's a strapped juicy wine with tons of coffee chocolate and berry essence. It's too hard or layered so get at it soon for its up-front fruit and character.,Chile,Carmenère
In recent years with winemaker Enrique Tirado firmly at the helm Don Melchor has gotten better and better. And while 2004 was an average year in Chile this ranks as the best Melchor we've sampled. The wine has beautiful blackberry cola and pepper aromas in front of cassis cherry plum nutmeg and cinnamon flavors. It's brawny but balanced with excellent natural acidity. Best from 2008–2012.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
This score for a $22 Chilean Malbec may cause you to do a double-take but this is really a great wine. The nose is chock full of berry aromas with earth and leather riding shotgun. Flavors and finishing notes of chocolate truffles espresso berry syrup and mocha sum it up. The structure is here as is the core acidity. This wine has everything. Imported by Atlanta Improvement Co.,Chile,Malbec

Although it's not very aromatic the nose on this wine is easygoing with mild peach and apple aromas. It feels fresh and medium bodied with apple peach and melony flavors the latter perhaps due to the blend's 14% white Carmenère. It shows mellow oak notes and latent acidity on the finish.,Chile,Chardonnay
Piercing black cherry and cassis aromas are a touch rustic and massive but hey that's old-vines Carignan from Maule (this one also contains 12% Cinsault). So saturated that it's beastly on the palate this tastes of hard-rolling blackberry and black plum. Plenty of gritty spice tomato and integrated oak fill out the menu. Drink through 2025.,Chile,Red Blend

Tropical notes on the nose are as good as it gets; otherwise it smells like air freshener. In the mouth it's waxy and flat with bland apple and vanilla flavors. Finishes pithy.,Chile,Chardonnay
Generic and monotone on the nose. The palate is nothing more than wet and chunky while the flavors are soft sweet and candied with vanilla and toffee overriding any fruit. A creamy dullard with a lot of vanilla and hardly any pulse.,Chile,Chardonnay
Barely noticeable lime and orange aromas sit mute on the nose which is reduced and artificial smelling. The palate has a hard feel and generic flavors of white fruits. Amid sweetness there's a chemical bitterness. Not one of this winery's better products.,Chile,Viognier

Impressive as always with dense meaty aromas of baked black fruits compost and dried cheese. The palate is thick to the max with chocolate coconut and baked plum and berry flavors. Ultrarich on the finish with warmth and density. Once again M shows how deep and rewarding high-end Chilean reds can be. Drink now through 2015.,Chile,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
This wine has traveled miles in the right direction compared to its early incarnations. It's piercing and potent up front with cigar box mocha toast and coffee aromas in addition to fine flavors of tobacco cassis vanilla and lightly baked berry and cassis.

Raw abrasive plum and berry aromas are grassy. This passable Merlot is rubbery and pinched in feel with herbal generic berry flavors that finish with a weedy accent.,Chile,Merlot

This tan-colored brut is outright oxidized and bready from front to tail. A foamy full palate is awkward while this tastes yeasty and stale as oxidized wines often do.,Chile,Sparkling Blend
Aromas of chewing gum dust are not attractive. This feels flat with zero edge and structure. Lightly oxidized flavors of generic berry leave one with nothing to latch on to.,Chile,Pinot Noir

Just two things hold it back: The texture is a bit flat and the acidity could use a jolt.,Chile,Chardonnay
The aromas are a touch prickly and sharp and there's some heavy oak on the nose. But in the mouth it's more harmonious with sweet fruit and more than enough barrel spice. The finish is simple and clean so it fades away nicely. The only problem is a lasting salty wood-dominated essence.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon

The palate is slightly sugary but the black fruit is ripe and tasty. And the tannins are there as they should be although they're not overwhelming. Best Buy.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon

The nose starts out herbal and rowdy but then settles down to offer basic pear and apple aromas. The palate is all pineapple and other racy fruits but it's also sweet and a bit discordant.

Morandé's top Chardonnay is a single-vineyard offering from the oldest vineyard in Casablanca Valley and is aged in French oak.

Oak is good but still overshadows the fruit.,Chile,Chardonnay

Drink through 2020.,Chile,Syrah

Mildly gassy and barnyardy on the nose with berry vanilla and lactic flavors running second. This wine is on the soft creamy side of the fence. It almost shows some cloying qualities before dialing things back. Still it could use more definition and structure; as is it's tasty but a little flat.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon
Melon and candied aromas are sweet and soon some toasty oak enters the fray. Flavors of candy corn ripe apples and mango get a boost from the oak and overall the feel is properly zesty and not too resiny or milky.
