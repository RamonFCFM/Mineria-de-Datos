Gritty aromas of grilled beef and asphalt blend with savory berry scents. Frankly this is rough on the palate with abrasive tannins. Savory herbal green-leaning flavors are peppery and bitter on a grabby finish.,Argentina,Malbec

Piattelli is an under-the-radar label that makes very good to excellent Malbec from old vines in Luján del Cuyo Mendoza. And the prices are more than fair.

This opens with a familiar taste of artificial roasted char then it moves on to soupy berry aromas. It feels scratchy with flavors of hickory baked plum and berry.,Argentina,Merlot

Floral blueberry aromas are candied artificial smelling and sweet and the palate is supremely rich sweet candied and unctuous. About as thick and ripe as you get in a value Malbec but also over the top with baked fruit and candy. Needs to be dialed back a notch.,Argentina,Malbec

Minerally melon and citrus aromas are good and lead to a nice creamy feeling palate with a full mix of lime melon apple green herb and spice flavors. This is round and lightly citric on the finish. Drink immediately.,Argentina,Pinot Gris

The style is obtuse and the wine is sweet as sin and unctuous. Aromas of canned pear and peach suggest a lot of residual sugar.,Argentina,Chardonnay

More salady and green than you'd expect with hints of vinaigrette and chunky berry on the nose. The palate is more syrupy and creamy than we'd like to see with green-ish berry flavors followed by a finish of milk chocolate and bramble. Kind of mauling in terms of feel.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Chunky and clunky on the nose and unlike previous vintages this one requires more patience and a willingness to overlook some flaws. For starters the wine has a milky nose.

Good but not as good as in the past.,Argentina,Bonarda

Past its sell-by date with mealy aromas and dull flavors of apple and banana. The feel is flat the acidity is not there and the finish is bland and a little bitter.,Argentina,Sauvignon Blanc
Off the grid and strange smelling with jumbled aromas that are hard to describe. Exceedingly sour and lean on the palate with a vegetal finish.,Argentina,Malbec

Rock solid clean and composed. For the past several years this Malbec-Merlot-Cabernet blend has been an Argentine flag-bearer and the '05 is as good as past vintages.

This is like a fat fastball in the proverbial wheel house; just see it and swing away.,Argentina,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Focused berry aromas are cool and smell slightly rubbery. A medium-bodied good-quality palate features generic but pleasant plum and berry flavors while the finish holds steady with a dash of spice and complexity.,Argentina,Malbec

A different style of Mendoza Malbec (with 30% Merlot) and for the most part it's intriguing and satisfying.

Finishes smoother than up front with woodspice and pepper coming on strong. Drink now through 2010.,Argentina,Red Blend
Expensive by South American standards but at least it's no imposter. This is high-class Chardonnay with toast apple and quince aromas.

But is it worth $39? 280 cases made.,Argentina,Chardonnay
For Argentinean Chardonnay this has chops. The nose is fleshy and ripe with pineapple candy corn and peach scents.

Oily gritty stone-fruit aromas announce a plump soft palate with papaya and banana flavors. A mealy quality and bitterness rise up on the finish.,Argentina,Chardonnay
This starts out massive and grapy but with each passing minute it becomes more Salta and hence more complex. Feral leathery roasted-berry aromas require patience.

Raging acidity and firm tannins suggest that this needs at least until 2016 to settle.,Argentina,Malbec
The nose offers both minerally crispness and full-fledged black-fruit aromas. Chunky and meaty in feel the wine has baked loamy flavors of blackberry and plum that hold onto their vitality. A medium-long finish with hints of salted beef leather and chocolate provides for a good ending.,Argentina,Malbec

Jammy berry fruits violet notes and graham cracker define the bouquet on this high-quality good-value Malbec.

On the finish it's chocolaty and spicy but loses steam quickly.,Argentina,Malbec
After a few nice vintages of Sol Huarpe from this San Juan producer the 2007 is sharp and weighed down by rhubarb and burnt field aromas. The palate is thin while the flavors are mildly vegetal and soupy. Finishes crisp and citrusy. Blame it on the vintage.,Argentina,Malbec
Reserved on the nose with a hint of rhubarb and bramble. But where this wine really fails to impress is on the palate. It's sharp and underdeveloped with tart cherry aromas and piercing acidity.

Imported by Multiple U.S. Importers.,Argentina,Malbec
Spicy tomato aromas show an herbal side as well as red plum and cranberry notes. In the mouth this is ratcheted down and crisp with fine acidity creating ideal Pinot framework.

Wild berry licorice and plum aromas are solid but quiet. This Cabernet is built on leathery tough tannins and roasted savory flavors of saucy berry and plum. A spunky savory tasting finish is tomatoey and leathery with leftover sauciness. Drink through 2020.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Cool grapy black-fruit aromas are front and center on the nose. This feels dense and a touch hard and tannic.

Drink through 2020.,Argentina,Malbec

Drink now through 2013.,Argentina,Malbec

Lo Tengo which means “I have it” in Spanish is Norton's fun and trendy Torrontés. It's not meant to be serious—it's more of a nightclub or aperitif white—but it does come across as a true but limited Torrontés.

Drink through 2017.,Argentina,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon

Eight years down the line and this Malbec shows the flaws caused by a harvest marred by freezes. This smells like a mix of green bean and jammy boysenberry. The palate feels saturated but soupy with outsize acidity. Green-herb flavors mix with baked plum and blueberry while the finish feels sticky tannic and heavy.,Argentina,Malbec
Aromas of mocha rubber smoky leather and berry fruit indicate good things to come but in the mouth this wine fails to deliver equal to its price and the previous successes of Trapiche's single-vineyard Malbec project. Scouring acidity is the main culprit; the wine seems clipped tartaric and angular thus it's all superficial and not deep or rich enough to rate better.,Argentina,Malbec

This is called Roble meaning oak for a reason; the nose is extremely smoky toasty and gritty with stalky cherry and cassis scents and a blast of animal hide.

Blackberry cassis and floral aromas are the lead actors on a musky nose. This ripe Malbec feels thick and syrupy while rich flavors of blackberry cassis chocolate and mocha finish smooth but shy. For such a big wine this is light on tannic bite. Drink through 2021.,Argentina,Malbec

This is a severely oaked wine that sizzles and smokes with aromas of campfire creosote road tar and coconut. On the palate it's concentrated but also brutish.

Heavy oak is a major theme on this full-bodied Malbec that's cool and woody to start with aromas of vanilla and sweet plastic along with ripe blackberry and cassis.

Not sure what differentiates this from Reserve but the Barrel Select seems better balanced.,Argentina,Merlot

Purple to the eye with intense aromas of mint licorice and saturated black fruit. The mouth is like blueberry-blackberry compote while the oak seems heavy given the wine's higher acids and limited depth. Has plenty of positives but sings just one note.,Argentina,Malbec
Perfect color combined with one of the more atypical but interesting bouquets you'll find stirs intrigue.

This is a bruising wine with a unique Mendoza identity.,Argentina,Tempranillo
Baked berry coffee molasses and horse hide are the aromas on this tight rugged Malbec that shows a clipped choppy mouthfeel in front of lightly herbal berry flavors. This is grabby and firm on the finish without much cushion. Pour this with grilled meats and it will show best.,Argentina,Malbec

Herbal rubbery plum aromas are fully oaked and thus there's a campfire/brush fire quality to the nose. There's energy on the palate which holds steady and feels in tune. Spicy herbal red-berry flavors with a ton of secondary oak finish mild and dry.,Argentina,Malbec
Stewy foresty aromas of dark berry fruits are rustic and show a hint of graphite. This is severe on the palate with hard pinching tannins. Stalky salty flavors of roasted black plum and blackberry finish similarly with tannic bite.,Argentina,Malbec
The off color of this wine is a hint that it's unusual and a white from Pinot Noir is indeed not too common. This shows roundness with acidic balance. A pop of melon and peach flavors turns slightly bitter on a fresh yet fairly long finish.,Argentina,Pinot Noir
Raspberry and plum aromas include notes of brown sugar and warm pavement. A dense chewy palate is packed with fruit and tannins. Flavors of minty oak and berry fruits dissolve into a heap of tannin and oak on the finish.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon

Purple in color and smells like sweet fruit citrus peel and powdered drink mix. Round in the mouth with generic plum and berry flavors that don't taste all that much like classic Pinot Noir. A simple bulky wine that's young and probably not going very far.,Argentina,Pinot Noir
Licorice and char on the nose hint at size and ripeness but the palate does not deliver. Tart raspberry and red-plum flavors are sweet for a fleeting moment and then decidedly sour while the finish is bland. Shows a few positives but overall it's too snappy and sharp for Malbec.,Argentina,Malbec
Floral young and jumpy smelling with gumball aromas that leave you with the impression that the wine's clarity balance and purity may be tenuous. The palate is raw but fresh with simple but snappy wild berry flavors. Not a lot of structure or depth here.,Argentina,Malbec
This wine is herbal and burns on the nose where aromas of horseradish and tomato sauce don't really work. Flavors of raisin brandy and black cherry are hardened by fierce tannins and a chemical-like dryness. Rubs like sandpaper on the palate.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Nothing much sublime about Sublimis. The nose is reedy and sweet with licorice and overripe raisiny aromas. The palate is big and grabby with clamp-down tannins and hard crusty raisiny flavors. A bruising red without elegance.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Rhubarb and vinegar on the nose are ominous signs. The wine maintains a briary sharp personality in the mouth where red-fruit flavors have an extra juicy feel. Fresh as a cold winter's morning but is that really what you want from Malbec?,Argentina,Malbec
Oily and funky on the nose with a custardy eggy undercurrent. The palate is oily and dull while the flavors are of bitter citrus pith and banana. In two words: not great.,Argentina,Chardonnay

Brambly berry and leather aromas are rustic. This Malbec is hard and acidic. Short generic plum and berry flavors don't expand or improve on the finish.,Argentina,Malbec
This wine needs air in order to get at its dark-fruit aromas. In the mouth this blend of Malbec Petit Verdot and Cab Franc is ripe but smacks down hard with tannins. Flavors of blackberry cassis and herbs end with complex notes of graphite and chalk. This gets better the more time you spend with it. Drink through 2024.,Argentina,Bordeaux-style Red Blend

This is Torrontes in its pure true form. Trapiche has captured the light floral essence of the grape and wrapped it in an oily but smooth package that houses lovely green apple and papaya flavors.

Drink now through 2009.,Argentina,Merlot
By far the best wine in the El Fogón lineup is this Torrontes. The nose is clean and harmonious with light flower blossom scents. A citrusy mix blends with both apple and pear fruit on the palate and the finish is clean if a bit sweet (residual sugar?). Drink as soon as possible.,Argentina,Torrontés
Early sulfur and rotten-egg aromas are none too attractive but in the mouth the wine is better. While sweet as sin the soft lush palate is a chocolate-lover's dream and the finish is like mocha ice cream. Low acidity makes the structure sort of weak but drink it now and that may not matter.,Argentina,Malbec
Neutral aromas of apple and peach kick it off then round citrus and a mild hint of pickled vegetable and apple carry the palate. This is a fleshy basic Chardonnay with youthful bounce and a touch of additional pickle on the finish. Drink soon.,Argentina,Chardonnay

It feels round chewy tough and healthy with flavors of baked black fruit chocolate molasses and hickory. Roasted and oaky but cool and collected. Drink now through 2016.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon

A lasting finish is spicy herbal and mildly green in flavor.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
After an opening of tomato red plum and berry aromas this shows a smooth texture and a full body. Berry ripe plum and cocoa flavors finish with medium tannins and good length.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon

This runs spicy and lightly herbal in terms of flavors while wood spice cinnamon and herbs compete with mocha and chocolaty black-fruit notes on the finish.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
This warm-climate Chardonnay displays aromas of baked apple toast and spice. It's resiny and heavy in the mouth but there's enough acidity to maintain balance. Flavors of honeyed peach baked apple cinnamon and white pepper finish in tropical fashion where banana is the lasting fruit note.,Argentina,Chardonnay
Snappy prickly red-currant aromas fail to improve with airing. The palate is high in acidity creating a sheer feel to the cherry and raspberry fruit that drives the flavor profile. Drying and hollow on the finish. Very regular wine with bramble and tartness.,Argentina,Malbec
Dark crusty aromas mix with sweet coconut on the nose while the palate seems lactic and oaky despite fairly pointed acidity. Berry and plum flavors are entirely regular and the finish is sharp due to the aforementioned acidity. A bit leafy tasting as well.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Dull and dilute but painless. The palate is chunky but with enough acids to stay lively and the flavors of green apple lemon and pineapple are decent enough. Tangy and slightly bitter on the finish.,Argentina,Pinot Grigio
Chunky and generic smelling with a nutty oily palate that isn't purely focused or clean. The palate has some bitterness and excess weight along with fading lychee and melon flavors. Not a terrible wine for $9 but the low price doesn't erase its flaws.,Argentina,Torrontés
Hot and rubbery on the nose and while it doesn't smell bad it doesn't persuade you to go further. The palate has size but it's not smooth as the acids dominate. And the flavors of berry and cherry are generic and almost impossible to identify as Syrah. Forgettable wine with tartness.,Argentina,Syrah
Bland and chunky with aromas of talcum powder and apple. The palate feel is a mix of spritz and heft and the flavors of melon and peach are pithy and lean toward bitter. Dusty and heavy on the finish an indication that it won't last long and has already seen better days.,Argentina,Bordeaux-style White Blend
Roasted oaky and resiny on the nose and then the palate delivers a bolt of acidity that makes the wine feel pointy in the mouth. The flavors are herbal and resiny with foresty black fruit at the core. Creamy and sticky on the finish and overall it struggles to present a pure balanced picture.,Argentina,Syrah
Flat on the nose with neutral slightly floral aromas. The palate is zesty and tart with midland flavors of lemon sour apple and lime. Chalky but o.k. on the finish. A one-dimensional white with hardly any lasting potential.,Argentina,Pinot Gris
Herbal raspberry and strawberry aromas are raw and a bit green. This feels scratchy as well with tomatoey flavors of red currant and plum skins. A modest finish is racy in feel but mild in flavor.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Light cherry and raspberry aromas come in front of a grabby rubbery palate. This tastes like salty plum with little variation of that theme. A solid finish tastes exactly like what came before.,Argentina,Malbec

Seems more clipped and underdone than the 2005 with narrow tannins and a medicinal burn. Has its merits and its intentions seem true but something's not quite clicking here.,Argentina,Malbec
Subtle aromas of minerals rose petal and red berry are not overdone. In the mouth it has astringency hard tannins and an overall narrow feel.

One of the Uco Valley's highest vineyards has produced an awkward funky clunky Chardonnay with butterscotch mustard and heavy oak aromas.

Salentein needs to reassess this wine which is new to its lineup.,Argentina,Chardonnay

Big but scattered. The nose mixes incongruent aromas of green beans chocolate and wood resin before transitioning to a palate of wood spice and generic berry fruit flavors. Too chewy resiny and woody and lacking harmony.,Argentina,Malbec
The Torrontes character shows on the nose meaning there's detectable lychee and orange blossom scents. The dowside is that the palate is rather thick and honeyed but devoid of flavor. Seems to be fading into the night.,Argentina,White Blend
Light green in color with standard Torrontes aromas of acacia and tropical fruits. The palate is simple and delivers solid flavors of lychee melon and green herbs; somewhat cloying and confected.,Argentina,Torrontés
Very dark and charred but at the same time it smells like a fudge milkshake mixed with espresso. It's plump but loose in structure with generic black-fruit flavors and strange acidic kick.,Argentina,Bonarda
Sharp and tight on the nose and then it stays narrow and rather punishing on the palate. It's a tangy gritty tough wine with tart red-fruit flavors and bitter coffee note on the finish. Malbec-Syrah-Tempranillo is the blend.,Argentina,Red Blend
Dark heavy and foresty on the nose with astringent cherry and coffee flavors. Sharp in terms of feel with plenty of leftover acidity on the finish. Tartaric acid is all over this wine.,Argentina,Red Blend
Strained funky aromas of corn chips don't include much fruit. This is mostly acid on the palate while it tastes raw choppy and citric. A tart finish fails to rescue this substandard rosé.,Argentina,Rosé
Rubbery jammy unfocused berry aromas are blurry. This feels heavy and low on pulse. Flavors of stewed plum and berry fruits end with a mild weedy green note.,Argentina,Malbec
Soupy horsey citrus and red-berry aromas precede a flabby palate with herbal red-berry flavors that upon inspection taste both sugary and green.,Argentina,Rosé
Dilute cherry aromas are not convincing. Wiry on the palate this tastes like a mix of berry syrup and tomato. A salty linear finish turns tart to the point of sour.,Argentina,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
The barn door is open and the horses have left. This is close to DOA with mushy weak aromas and flavors and almost no distinct fruit at any point.,Argentina,Torrontés
Sharp feline and citrus aromas announce an edgy citric palate. This Moscatel has a lot of Sauvignon character throughout including flavors of lime scallion and green herbs. An oily pithy finish makes for a harsh ending.,Argentina,Moscatel
Rough grassy aromas and flavors along with a choppy mouthfeel render this one rung above unacceptable. Overall this is about as raw punchy green and herbaceous as a Malbec can get.,Argentina,Malbec
Dark oaky aromas suggest shoe polish and spice and these scents go well with raisiny berry and cassis notes. A wiry high-acid palate shows strong tannins along with flavors of blackberry raisin and leather. A wiry choppy acidic finish tastes minty and oaky.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Spicy mossy aromas are cool and herbal and with that there are grapy toasty and chocolaty oak scents. This Malbec blend is tight and rugged with clampy red-bery flavors resting on that same chocolaty oak. Drying tannins make for a hard finish that should mellow in due time. Drink through 2021.,Argentina,Red Blend
Dry focused aromas of spiced apple are fairly classy. This has a bready smooth mouthfeel with substantial malic cut. Full dynamic flavors of nectarine apple and citrus turn slight bitter before a layered long palate.,Argentina,Champagne Blend

Earthy rubbery red-berry aromas lead to a hard-drilling palate with fiery cherry flavors and an allotment of herbal mint. The hollow finish leaves a salty flavor and heat.,Argentina,Malbec

Dry leafy spicy aromas have a perfumed accent. A pushy forward-feeling palate houses similar oaky flavors of cherry. On the finish it turns woody with resiny flavors and drawing tannins.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Tropical fruit and melon aromas are basic but friendly. This has a punch-like mouthfeel as well as open-knit flavors of orange nectarine white grapefruit and apple. What it lacks in finesse is made up for in fruit.,Argentina,Chardonnay
Immediately you know this is heavily oaked because the nose is charred and minty to the max. Airing pushes things toward tobacco and cedar but it still tastes woody and resiny. Fruit notes of cassis plum and cherry are spicy while overall acidity is drawing.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Dry peppery field notes and the scent of lanolin set up a plump palate with briny nectarine and salty mango flavors. A round finish holds onto this salty tropical character.,Argentina,Chardonnay
A scent of fresh-squeezed orange juice is likable while this feels grabby and rubbery but hollow. The finish is all flavors of apple and pickled green fruits.,Argentina,Gewürztraminer
With little fruit to the nose this cool-climate Chardonnay smells strained. A chunky palate has a canned-fruit character tasting faintly of peach and mandarin orange. It lacks freshness fruit and varietal correctness.,Argentina,Chardonnay
Charred smoky herbal aromas of blackberry trend in the direction of exotic before showing barrel-driven scents of vanilla and clove.

Rich heady aromas of black fruits oaky char and caramel are lusty and modern. In the mouth this shows a bolt of acidity that creates energy but also strains the wine's balance. Baked blackberry chocolate pepper and vanilla flavors finish long ripe and oaky with length derived from lasting acidity. Drink through 2021.,Argentina,Malbec
Nice and pure with controlled berry aromas a dash of pepper and integrated background oak. A tasty easy-to-drink wine with fine balance and fresh flavors of cherry raspberry cassis chocolate and a medicinal finish. Good depth length and size throughout. Delicious Malbec.,Argentina,Malbec
Aromas of sandalwood violets and berries give this one an elevated magnetic nose while the palate is lush big and full of black fruit and masculine tannins. A dark minerally style from high-elevation vineyards with a coating of vanilla and caramel on the long finish.,Argentina,Malbec
A fine wine from Septima most likely with Malbec at its base (though the label says nothing of the sort). Aromas of blackberry raspberry perfume pepper and asphalt are attractive and the rooty richness and slight medicinality of the core flavors are unique but not out of focus. One of the winery's best wines to date.,Argentina,Red Blend
This smells of exotic blueberry and graham cracker and it feels wide and solid with herbal woodsy flavors of juniper and plum. Dry and healthy on the finish this made from 75% Malbec with Cabernet Sauvignon Syrah and Tannat in the blend.,Argentina,Red Blend
Fairly quiet on the nose but there's just enough varietal character to help it along. The palate is fresh and zingy with apple and apricot flavors in front of a clean short simple finish. Perfectly adequate white wine but that's about as far as it goes.,Argentina,Torrontés
A solid and appealing large-format wine that is 60% Malbec and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is composed and shows honest aromas of blackberry and cassis. It's juicy and fresh in the mouth with decent berry fruit but not much in the way of trimmings i.e. oak tannins depth or length. Still for value hunters it'll get the job done.,Argentina,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
Smoky earthy and refined on the nose this Cab is showing a seamless mix of berry and oak-based aromas. Full moderately tannic layered and thorough on the palate this tastes of baked berry fruits integrated oak and loamy earth. A ripe yet balanced finish indicates that aging is needed. Drink through 2025.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Aromas of roast plum and earth are a bit nutty and muddled but overall this is a likable and slick wine with soft tannins and ripe candied-fruit flavors. With lushness and cola on the finish it ends a bit syrupy and sweet. Good but not what you'd call refined or elevated.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
With solid peach aromas and an otherwise clean nose this llama is worth the ride. Peach and honeydew flavors are sweet but not cloying or mucky and there's even a hint of spicy white pepper to give the finish character.,Argentina,Chardonnay
Lively nectarine and citrus aromas give it early life and the palate is equally zesty with tangerine and pineapple flavors. This is good Sauvignon Blanc for Argentina with plenty of citrus but not a lot of nuance or complexity.,Argentina,Sauvignon Blanc
The Oak Cask in the name is evident in the bacon vanilla and creamy berry aromas that open things up. The palate however is fairly acidic making the fruit taste bright and feel zesty. Flavors of cherry and plum are distinctly red in character and the finish is quick and lean.,Argentina,Syrah
A light mildly stemmy and roasted Pinot with medium body and a solid mouthfeel. While not all that aromatic the wine tastes of strawberry raspberry and rhubarb and there are accents of pepper and herbs along the way and on the finish. Shows good weight and color.,Argentina,Pinot Noir
Cherry and plum aromas carry the mildest touch of stem yet the palate is reasonably stocky. Cherry and chocolate flavors may seem slightly confected but given the wine's price it's hard to register many complaints. A creamy and flavorful finish makes this well worth the money.,Argentina,Malbec

Fresh aromas of white gumdrop quince and peach precede a peachy citrusy palate. Dry citrus flavors persist on a clean finish. This is a fresh Chardonnay where less is more.,Argentina,Chardonnay

Pushy black-fruit flavors come with chocolate and herbal notes while this tastes of chocolate mint and feels scratchy and tannic on the finish.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Dusty apple and peach aromas are mostly pleasant. Chunky and pulpy in feel this basic Chardonnay tastes of melon and peach. A dry fleshy finish includes a sprinkle of saltiness. Drink now.,Argentina,Chardonnay
Clean and well made but underwhelming. There's basic blueberry and blackberry flavors riding on a medium-bodied palate but overall the wine is more generic than specific. It's easygoing and causes no red flags to go up however at the end of the day it doesn't show much personality.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Light and generally neutral this is Torrontés that's easy to quaff. The nose is mildly citric but it doesn't go much further than that. And the palate is crisp with peach apple and nectarine flavors. Clean and medium on the finish; gets the job done. Drink now and drink well chilled.,Argentina,Torrontés
Among Argentinean Chardonnays Catena's Alta is among the very best.

Flavors of baked apple oak and spice lead to a long finish. Drink now–2014.,Argentina,Chardonnay
This may be the first time this wine has been labeled Reserve; in the past it was just Finca Sophenia Malbec. And truth be told it's a good but regular Malbec with berries and raisin on the bouquet and then juicy berry fruit on the palate. Solidly made with solid structure.,Argentina,Malbec
Fairly reduced leaving gaseous aromas to struggle with earthy fruit. Talk about chunky ripe fruit and soft tannins: this has almost no detectable grip or grab thus the structure is flabby and there's zero bite. Conversely the flavors are deep and the richness is up there. Drink now.,Argentina,Malbec

Although this is almost red in color and entering its twilight it's not bad for $8. Dusty berry aromas lead to a semifull palate with raspberry cherry and plum flavors that end in chewy dryness.,Argentina,Rosé

Despite the concept-driven name this is good Malbec at a good price. Minty black-fruit aromas are welcoming and stand up to scrutiny.

As far as Argentine Syrah goes this vintage of Iscay which contains 3% Viognier in a nod to France is the new benchmark for the country. Daniel Pi and Joey Tensley's wine discloses aromas of jammy berry fruits along with cardamom and floral notes.

Fresh berry and grapy aromas include hints of violet Graham Cracker and crème de cassis liqueur.

Harsh red-berry aromas are strained. This feels flabby and clumsy while weedy medicinal berry flavors do nothing to elevate this shaky hard-tannin Sangiovese.,Argentina,Sangiovese

All that said it has good flavors and aromas but falls down in the mouthfeel.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec

Wines like this are why Argentina would be best served sticking to reds. This has no bouquet to speak of and the palate is dilute tangy citrusy and sharp. Acceptable but that's it.,Argentina,Sauvignon Blanc

A more than solid wine cut from the tropical South American blueprint. It's open and full of banana pear and apple aromas and while it runs hot and fast on the palate it's got lots of woody ripe flavors of apple and pithy citrus. Round lively and packed with flavor even if it shows almost nothing in common with cool-climate Chardonnay.,Argentina,Chardonnay

Weinert has always pushed the more traditional less extracted style. And this Bordeaux blend shows a nose of light spice cinnamon wet clay and subdued berry fruit. The palate is earthy with hints of tomato herbs raspberry and cocoa. It's a drying wine with grabby tannins but it should age well for another few years. Drink now or hold through 2011.,Argentina,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
A big wine but some persistent sulphur and earthiness on the nose results in aromas of leather scrambled eggs and tobacco.

Drinkable now and best through 2010.,Argentina,Malbec
Woody berry and cassis aromas are inviting and strong. This feels high in acidity and maybe more racy than you'd expect for Luján.

Straightforward aromas of black currant and dark plum help create a rich style of Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a syrupy palate that's made firmer by driving tannins.

The palate is driven by energetic pounding tannins and flavors of black cherry and tomato which become more prominent as the tannins and acid rebound. This is an indication of how Argentine Cabernet Sauvignon ages.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Familar aromas of cherry plum and berry are on the money. This is tight as nails on the palate this and nevertheless thrusts with boysenberry blackberry and a hint of amaro. A wall of finishing tannin carries flavors of chocolate and black spice. Big ripe and serious.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon

Rubber mushroom and smoke rise up on the hot molten nose while the palate is hard tough to penetrate and narrow with dark berry and piercing pepper accents. Tough to dig into and find higher qualities. Thus it comes across as a surface wine without much depth or elegance.,Argentina,Malbec
Almost red in color and maybe already past its prime. Crios was a standout in 2006 but the '07 is chunky and sweet smelling with ripe but dull apple melon and nectarine flavors. Soft and already in its late stages; probably best to wait for the 2008.,Argentina,Malbec
Try as we might to understand very ripe Bonarda blended with low-acid Malbec it doesn't make sense...and this example doesn't help much. It's a little green and funky with mineral asphalt and prune aromas. The palate is soft semidark and baked with chocolate and medium tannins on the finish. A strange blend that comes out strange.,Argentina,Red Blend
Santa Carolina of Chile is behind this Uco Valley producer and for two years running this wine has rated the same. It starts with adequate but generic plum and blackberry aromas yet the palate is acidic and tangy with slightly herbal black fruit and raspberry flavors. Decent but not what you'd call a distinguished Cabernet. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Not bad but fading. This Trebbiano-Chardonnay blend features apple aromas and flavors and then some quince and orange around the edges. Soft with some banana on the finish. Drink right away because it won't last much longer.,Argentina,Trebbiano

Feels tight and zesty with Italian-leaning flavors of tomato oregano and basil along with cassis and strawberry. Crisp and agile on the finish but tastes green.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Fiery stuff with aromas that suggest cheese and leather. The mouth has a forward feel and then leafy herbal berry flavors with sides of compost and leather. Lightly herbal on the finish and while it's big sweet and chunky it doesn't click to the maximum.,Argentina,Malbec
A bit warm and baked on the nose with aromas of fruit cake and pastry. The palate is full-bodied and chewy with ripe sweet black fruit flavors that finish with vanilla and chocolate.,Argentina,Malbec-Tempranillo

This Syrah smells meaty and roasted with savory spice aromas and plenty of black fruit on the nose. It's chewy and creamy feeling with blueberry and blackberry flavors in front of a short finish that's abrupt but clean.,Argentina,Syrah
For Argentina this is about as fresh and clean as Chardonnay gets. The nose is pure but basic with mineral and apple aromas. The palate feels good and correct while flavors of banana apple melon and vanilla are solid but not overly powerful.,Argentina,Chardonnay
Lightly herbal berry and plum aromas are uncomplicated. A medium-full palate tastes of generic berry fruits and plum. Rubbery tannins make for a tight drawing finish.,Argentina,Malbec
Buttercup and tropical fruit aromas are related to the 80% Torrontés in this blend (Viognier and Chardonnay are 10% each). This is plump but also high in acidity. Salty flavors of tropical fruits and pink grapefruit are retained on the finish.,Argentina,White Blend
Stalky baked aromas are bland. The wine feels tannic and scratchy while flavors of generic berry fruits are herbal reedy and wear a lot of cover-up oak. Minty herbal notes drive the finish on this green-leaning Cab.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Aromas of white fruits and apple are slightly mealy and set up flavors of melon and tangy but pithy citrus. The finish is even more pithy. Overall this wine feels like it's starting to fade.,Argentina,Pinot Grigio

Apricot peach pit and matchstick are the lead aromas on this basic Chardonnay. Flavors of melon and apricot are lightly oxidized and nutty while the finish is salty and slightly bitter with a dab of honey for an offset.,Argentina,Chardonnay
Aromas are raisiny and baked to the max. Likewise the palate seems chunky and heavy. Flavors of cooked berry fruits are loamy and flat while the finish lacks pulse.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
This salmon-colored rosé is past its peak. Gritty aromas are turning oily while the feel is chunky and sticky with a touch of lasting citric acidity. Flavors of melon and almond skins finish bitter.,Argentina,Rosé
Aromas of latex iodine and stewed berry fruits are challenging. This Cab Franc feels jumbled chunky and a bit out of shape. Herbal woody notes ride heavily on top of saucy lightly green berry flavors. It finishes with green-leaning mint basil and fennel notes.,Argentina,Cabernet Franc
Candied berry aromas include a mild spice note. This 50-50 blend of Cabernet and Malbec feels juicy but short on depth. Spicy briny red-fruit flavors dry out on a finish with red bell pepper and black-pepper notes.,Argentina,Red Blend
Jammy roasted aromas are more savory and offbeat than common and fruity. This Malbec has a fresh but choppy mouthfeel and flavors of tomato basil and herbal berry fruits. A savory finish conforms with the rest of the wine.,Argentina,Malbec
A hard coating of woodspice sits atop herbal plum and berry aromas. This feels tough and nearly impermeable. Spicy briary plum flavors are lean and taste woody on a dry tannic finish.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Stalky aromas of tomato leaf are light on fruit but generous on the oak. A creamy mouthfeel with soft acidity struggles to support flavors of stewed plum and brown sugar. Residual oak and related caramel flavors carry the finish.,Argentina,Pinot Noir

Grapey and inky on the nose this feels saturated and a bit hot on the palate with a candied blueberry flavor leading to a grapey finish. Tasted twice months apart with similar findings; this score reflects both tastings.,Argentina,Malbec
Scratchy black cherry aromas come with a strong hint of tree bark and cedar resin. This feels snappy at first then more resiny and oaky upon airing. Woody black-fruit flavors get a boost from juicy acidity while an oaky finish tastes like mint and licorice.,Argentina,Malbec
Oily citrus aromas are round and briny. This feels front-loaded meaning there isn't much depth to the palate. Short lightly stalky apple and citrus flavors turn pithy on the finish.,Argentina,Chardonnay
A little funky and jumpy at first but it settles down. Rapsberry pepper and a hint of green herb give it a snappy outlook and while it's mostly solid it may be a tiny bit stretched compared to others. In between the folds there's mocha pepper and a reedy bite. Nice wine with a couple of minor flaws.,Argentina,Syrah
Cadus from Nieto Senetiner has not been overly consistent in recent years. This wine is black as night with ultra-extracted aromas of black fruit and chocolate. The palate is hunky and chunky with clumsy grape cassis and blackberry flavors. Shows a blast of coconut and softness on the finish. A classic fruit bomb that's missing some key parts.,Argentina,Malbec
Jammy plum and berry aromas are tempered by notes of red fruits and currant. This is vibrant on the palate with saucy red-plum and currant flavors that aren't overextended. Tomato and dry spice flavors mark the crisp finish.,Argentina,Bonarda
Aromas of butterscotch vanilla and melony fruits rest comfortably in front of a smooth palate. Melon honey and floral flavors finish full but healthy courtesy of just-enough acidity.,Argentina,Sémillon
Dull aromas of murky leaves and wet cement don't set things up well. This is clunky and scouring in feel with leafy blackberry flavors that finish bitter.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Seemingly more candied and sweet than prior years but still a reasonably good generic-style Cabernet if you don't mind a little sucking candy and gumball along the route. Flavors of strawberry and cassis are sticky but ripe while the finish is chewy and sweet.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Somewhat smoky and earthy on the nose but also with some harshness that could be chalked up to youth. Acidity is a bit too high and there's some pickle to the bouquet and flavor profile. On the plus side as it opens core flavors of raspberry and red plum come across as solid.,Argentina,Merlot
Tropical aromas arise from the bouquet of this unoaked new Chardonnay and there's some pineapple and lemon-lime thrown in. Flavors of apple sauce cinnamon and lime juice are sweet and tasty while the mouthfeel is simple and fleshy. Drink now for the wine's youthful jump.,Argentina,Chardonnay
Quite raisiny and pruny from nose to palate to finish. But along the way there are touches of chocolate earth leather and cassis that help keep it afloat. And while we'd say it's probably too old and flat to warrant much of your time it does have just enough pulse to still be alive. Imported by Vinecrest Co.,Argentina,Malbec
Smoky spicy plum and berry aromas turn more stalky and herbal as this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon blend unwinds. In the mouth screechy acidity yields scratchiness while flavors of mocha black plum vanilla and stalky berry fruits finish tough with oversize residual tartaric acidity; drink through 2022.,Argentina,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
This global brand has a hit in Mendoza. The '06 Malbec is lively and made right with hickory and charred steak aromas mixing nicely with the blueberry and blackberry character in the wine. It's a darn good New World red for not much cash and it should hold up well for at least a couple of years.,Argentina,Malbec
Fairly smoky at first with background aromas of varietally appropriate game leather and animal. The palate mixes some earthy more nuanced flavors such tree bark baked plum and bitter chocolate; the finish is clean stout and medium long. A good wine with pure dark fruit flavors.,Argentina,Syrah
A lot of different aromas are vying for attention; there's spearmint potting soil tobacco and black fruits. The palate is saturated and pretty deep for what can best be described as a “value” wine. Flavors of blackberry and dark plums are wholesome and tasty. It's nicely balanced on the whole with medium tannins.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz
At first this seems over the top (it's 15.8%). But give the wine time and you'll find the ultimate presentation of ripeness richness and depth. The flavors are thick and black with chunky black plum prune syrup and more. But it's also healthy and not flabby with balance and a sense of being. Excellent if you like monster reds.,Argentina,Malbec
Potent Malbec with aromas of leather bacon blackberry and smoke. It's thick and dense but well balanced with flavors of blackberry cola pepper and nutmeg. More smooth and easy than complex with a long creamy sweet finish that cements the wine's character. Probably the best Felino Malbec to date and a good value at 20 bucks.,Argentina,Malbec
Give this Cabernet Sauvignon  time in the glass for initial rubbery aromas to subside  revealing berry and cassis scents. The mouthfeel is round and balanced with flavors of graham cracker blackberry and chocolate. A mellow finish that's fresh and friendly seals this wine's quality position.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
This is a varietally correct Cabernet with minty oak mild herb aromas and toasty solid berry fruit scents on the bouquet. Although it's a bit scouring and tough on the palate flavors of raspberry plum and herbs are spicy and right. On the finish oaky vanilla and lemony notes settle in.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
With floral violet aromas leather and meaty notes this smells bold and ready. A firm slightly reduced-feeling palate offers blue and black flavors of blueberry prune and bitter chocolate. The finish is a bit hot and narrow but shows power and intensity.,Argentina,Malbec
More minerally and tight than most with a bit of brine and lettuce to go with tropical fruit aromas. The palate is citrusy and features a beam of bright acidity that props up melon and citrus flavors. Full and forceful late with some burn to the finish.,Argentina,Torrontés
Floral raspberry aromas are jammy and funky like many Cafayate Malbecs are prone to be. This feels juicy but high in acidity so it's pointy on the palate. Exotic plum and raspberry flavors follow the nose while the finish is fresh high in acidity and low on cushion.,Argentina,Malbec
Aromas of cedar vanilla and cassis are the best part of this hard clampy ultratannic Cabernet. Flavors of vanilla and coconut soften and enrich screechy plum and red-berry fruit while this finishes with a dominating narrow tartaric feel.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Gaseous rubbery aromas are earthy. This feels solid but wiry and angular. Berry plum vanilla and mocha flavors finish with a shock of acidity and flavors of chocolate cherry and cassis.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon

Lightly tropical to begin with then more sheering and acidic in the mouth with high-toned jacked-up flavors of green apple pineapple and lemon. Quite snappy and fresh with an aggressive but true and correct finish.,Argentina,Torrontés
Dark in color and aromas. The nose starts out sulfuric and gassy but settles on rubber and earthy black fruit. In the mouth there's poking prodding acidity and basic flavors of blackberry herbal tea and leather. Grabby on the finish with a mild acidic scour.,Argentina,Malbec
Smells candied and gummy with sweet stewy red-berry aromas along with carob. The palate is fairly full and tannic with cooked herbal berry flavors that carry over onto the finish which folds in coffee and grabby tannins. Good enough but sort of stewed and candied.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Charred and smells of coffee toasted oak minty berry fruit and earth. The palate is quite tannic with creamy vanilla flavors along with candied berry fruit and lemony zest. Exhibits mostly faux oak and window dressing but for $11 it isn't bad.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Rusty in color for a young wine with mulchy faded berry fruit aromas. It has life on the palate which tastes earthy peppery and a little bit burnt. A dry spicy wine with cherry flavors interspersed.,Argentina,Merlot
Basic tropical aromas feature a touch of citrus. The palate is melony and chunky with tropical fruit flavors and sweet melon. Turns pithy and bitter on the finish. Soft and rapidly losing steam.,Argentina,Torrontés

Smells jumpy and musky like a wet dog in from the rain. The palate is brutally tannic and hard as rocks with sweet pasty berry flavors infused with vanilla. Finishes like the bouquet: foxy and funky.,Argentina,Malbec
A resiny oily nose is barrel heavy and a strong clue of what's to come. The palate has a thick syrupy feel and sweet almost sugary flavors of pear and melon. By the time it's wrapping up the wine veers towards cloying. Has its virtues but it's entirely too sweet in this critic's opinion.,Argentina,Chardonnay
Jammy and reduced on the nose with medicinal red berry and plum aromas. The palate is high in acidity with a mix of herbal berry roasted plum and leathery earthy flavors. Sheer on the finish where the acidity and tannic bite are forceful.,Argentina,Malbec

Muddled apple and spice aromas are o.k. and improve with familiarity. The palate runs narrow and tight with sharp acidity and stalky flavors of lemon green apple and lime. Finishes fresh and cutting with controlled pithiness. 70% Chardonnay and 30% SB.,Argentina,Chardonnay-Sauvignon
Sulphuric at first with citrus and air freshener aromas. The palate has a certain roundness and fleshy quality while the flavors are sweet melony and a little oily. Some almond-skin bitterness rises up late most likely reflecting the 25% Viognier in the blend.,Argentina,Chardonnay-Viognier
Oily citrus and barrel-based smoke aromas set up a palate that's deep and powerful. Flavors of spiced apple citrus and butterscotch are solid and don't fade over the course of a long slightly pithy tasting finish.,Argentina,Chardonnay
This opaque fully extracted blend of Malbec Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon smells outright grapy with a spunky pomegranate note. A syrupy laziness to the palate and jammy blackberry flavors finish chewy with a leaning towards Concord grape. Tasted twice with similar findings.,Argentina,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Rubbery spicy berry fruit aromas carry a note of salinity. The wine is boldly structured with hard tannins. Roast plum blackberry and spice flavors lean toward syrupy while a generous finish delivers ending power.,Argentina,Malbec
This almost translucent brick-colored Pinot offers aromas of lettuce leaf orange peel and dried red fruits. It's light edgy and fresh in feel with flavors of salted meat and herbal plum. A tangy citric finish is primed with racy acidity. Fermented and aged in egg-shaped cement tanks.,Argentina,Pinot Noir
Jammy oaky blueberry and cardamon aromas are proprietary for Mendoza Malbec.

Unabsorbed tartaric acidity on the finish creates a wiry feel while peppery spicy flavors are lasting and herbal.,Argentina,Malbec
Attractive berry aromas are candied and a tiny bit leafy. Tartaric acidity is front and center on the palate but there's enough tasty yet generic berry flavors along with notes of clove and chocolate to handle forced acidity.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
This Cabernet Franc blend opens with herbal oaky aromas of coffee and red fruits. The palate feels tartaric and shocking with heavy extraction and an overall wiry feel. Jacked-up berry flavors come with more than enough oak while this is steady but not finessed or elegant on the finish. Drink through 2021.,Argentina,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
This dark tannic Malbec with ripe black-fruit aromas hits the right notes on the nose. In the mouth things are tight and rubbery in feel. Salty blackberry flavors are rustic but balanced by a note of sweet marzipan. On the finish this is dry drawing and fiercely tannic. Drink through 2023.,Argentina,Malbec
This Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon blend opens with blueberry and currant aromas that hint at the exotic. A flush racy palate is high in acid and a touch abrasive.

Finishes sweet and chocolaty; could use a bit more structure and spine.,Argentina,Syrah
Earthy and spicy on the nose with tomato and raisin but also some herbal green which is likely attributable to the 50% Cabernet in this Malbec-CS blend. Tame on the palate with tomatoey notes and dry raspberry flavors. Simple and pleasant but more herbal and less exciting that Gradum's straight '05 Malbec.,Argentina,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon

Reedy and green on the nose then choppy and clipped on the palate. For a full-priced Malbec this is lacking in ripeness body and finesse; it's prickly and limited with green bean rhubarb and cranberry flavors. Not bad but underwhelming for $33.,Argentina,Malbec

Boysenberry and exotic notes of all-spice and cardamom set this Malbec apart from the field. In the mouth this is typically angular with sharp acidity and not much cushion.

Jammy and dark with big berry and coffee aromas. The palate has a hard intensity to it that I haven't seen before from this wine with bitterness along with black cherry chocolate and toasty flavors. It's forward firm and driving but always hard and angular. In its defense 2008 was a cool difficult year with frosts at harvest time.,Argentina,Malbec
Could the scent of microwaved popcorn be any stronger? Obviously it's heavily oaked and that carries onto the palate where you'll find heavy woody flavors in addition to banana and lemon. This needs a lot more charm and style; in all honesty it's not delivering much.,Argentina,Chardonnay
Clear as day in the glass with forced oak and spring flowers in the nose. In a word it's strange. In the mouth you'll get sweetness and other flavors not generally associated with Chardonnay. It's not necessarily a bad white wine but it is definitely at odds with typical Chardonnay.,Argentina,Chardonnay

Sweet and a little foxy on the nose with secondary aromas of air freshener. The flavors are a touch brambly and herbal while the palate is flush and chewy but also a little tannic and choppy. Doesn't seem as thought this is as structured and serious as it was say four or five years ago.,Argentina,Malbec
Touches of cola cherry and berry work the jammy bouquet and the reasonably sturdy body offers up flavors of berry backed by vanilla. There's ample grab and pretty good balance to this fresh wine.,Argentina,Shiraz
A lean acidic Malbec that defies the tried and true model of richness and lots of flavor. It has rhubarb and green raspberry aromas while the palate is short tart and herbal. Not a lot of definition here.,Argentina,Malbec
Strange Chardonnay. It smells and tastes more like feeble Torrontés than Chard. The palate offers only shearing apple fruit and the finish is hard. Can't imagine anyone pegging this as Chardonnay.,Argentina,Chardonnay
Not very fruity with gritty cherry flavors and a hard edgy almost sour profile. Does nothing for the reputation of Merlot in Argentina. Overpriced too.,Argentina,Merlot
This Malbec blend is bright jammy and grapy on the nose. The palate is juicy but bumpy and rough in feel while fresh-fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry are a little too candied and simple for a wine of this level. A ripe medicinal finish is lush but awkward.,Argentina,Red Blend
A bit of dust and leather for openers with short black-fruit flavors and a big wave of tannins on the palate. So expect some grab and choppiness. Despite moderate hardness there's good dark fruit and limited herbal intrusion.,Argentina,Malbec
Obvio means obvious in Spanish and this is an obvious yet fairly good Malbec. There's some ground spice cinnamon and a little bretty cheese to the nose but the palate is solid and the berry and cherry flavors are correct for the variety. Best by the glass or in casual settings.,Argentina,Malbec

This blend of 80% Malbec with 20% Syrah is dense and rich but a touch flat on the nose with blueberry and cumin accents.

This yellow-tinted blend of Friulano Chardonnay Viognier and Pinot Gris is classy and smoky on the nose with no shortage of toasty oak. Core apple melon and citrus flavors are rich and smooth while this finishes round and full in body. Corte Friulano is really good for an oddball Argentine white blend.,Argentina,White Blend
With feline aromas of juniper bush grass and sweaty citrus this is true Sauvignon Blanc. Oak aging has lent an easiness to the mouthfeel which shows good acidity.

On the finish more chocolate along with fig and baked berry flavors seal this rich ripe offering. Drink through 2022.,Argentina,Malbec
Earthy woodsy aromas of black plum are robust and gritty.

Resiny oak sticks out while the palate is grabby and sticky in feel. This tastes like lemony pushcart hotdogs and the briny water they sit in followed by a woody low-fruit finish.,Argentina,Chardonnay

Spearmint and weedy red-fruit aromas lead to raw palate. This is more herbal than fruity with a lean rubbery finish.,Argentina,Malbec

Controlled berry and plum aromas are pure and not mucked up by too much oak. Like all Luca wines this Syrah is bulky full-framed and meaty. It's extracted but well balanced with mellow fruit and a dark crusty finish. Very pleasant and chunky but not overwhelming. Drink now or over the next year or two.,Argentina,Syrah
A big woody totally modern style of Syrah. There is a lot more coconut mocha and big berry fruit than anything you might find from France.

Mild light aromas of apple toast mineral and petrol are solid before they evaporate while the palate is easygoing and on target with citrus and apple flavors. Without calling it overly exciting or complex we like the mix of Chardonnay and Viognier because it's lively fresh and perfectly drinkable.,Argentina,Chardonnay-Viognier

A yellow color announces that this isn't in tip-top shape. Stalky waxy aromas confirm that while a chunky creamy feeling palate is low on acid and is showing oxidized Sherry-like aromas of vanilla and nuts.,Argentina,Chardonnay

Burnt edgy and stemmy/stalky from start to finish. The nose gives off a charred nut and asphalt character while the palate is edgy hard and bitter with briary flavors of roasted fruit and stems. Questionable and compromised for the price.,Argentina,Malbec
Medicinal soupy and not fully clicking. The nose is fishy and the palate has a grating feel and flavors of dried fruits cola and caramel. Finishes with a toffee-like sweetness and wayward buttery flavors.,Argentina,Malbec

A little scattered and jumbled at first but once things settle this Bordeaux blend is impressive.

In an attempt to ramp things up Rutini has a wine that's loaded with candied black fruit tire rubber and a distinct green streak.

Not one of Rutini's better efforts.,Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon
Earthy and showing clay milk chocolate baked cherry and mocha aromas and flavors and while the wine feels fairly smooth it doesn't do much but lay there on the palate. Kind of heavy amorphous and seemingly fading and overall it's a junior version of Salentein's dying Primum Pinot from 2004.,Argentina,Pinot Noir
Tropical on the nose with floral lychee aromas that seem more like Torrontés than typical Sauvignon Blanc. In the mouth the feel is basic with sweet flavors of lychee mango and melon. Vacuous on the finish but overall it's not going to turn anyone off.,Argentina,Sauvignon Blanc

This yellowish SB from Argentina's northern Salta region is a strange bird that has never caught our fancy. This vintage shows melon peach lychee and wax aromas while the palate is both sweet and tart with a fresh-for-now feel that doesn't inspire confidence that it will last for long. Flat on the finish and unsusual overall.,Argentina,Sauvignon Blanc
