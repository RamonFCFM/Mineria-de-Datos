65857,Portugal,"Despite containing only a small percentage of Cabvernet Sauvignon, the herbal—almost vegetal—scent of unripe Cabernet dominates this wine. It's plump and round in the mouth, yet has a distinctly unripe character to it. If you can, track down the 2001 instead—it's much better.

65947,Portugal,"Blending Alvarinho and Trajadura, oenologist Anselmo Mendes has created a deliciously creamy but dry style of Vinho Verde.

65965,Portugal,"A blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon, with Touriga Nacional, to give a tight wine, solid, taking its austerity from the 2006 vintage. The berry fruits offer structure, and allow the wine to finish with a fresh note.",Termeão,88,30.0,Bairrada,,,Portuguese Red,Campolargo
66096,Portugal,"A full, weighty, fat wine, almost new world Chardonnay in its texture and richness.

68354,Portugal,"An exotic blend including Pinot Noir and Merlot along with Portuguese varieties, taking its name from two local villages with saints' names.

104366,Portugal,"Showcasing the richness of 2009 without sacrificing fine structure, this is stylish and concentrated. Dark black fruit accompanies a tight, minerality and a fine shaft of acidity. This single-vineyard offering is worth aging for 2–3 years.",Tinto,88,15.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta de Ventozelo
104389,Portugal,"Freshly perfumed, almost sweet in character. It has flavors that hint at fruit candies, the acidity so light, the structure so gentle.",,84,7.0,Portuguese Table Wine,,,Portuguese Red,Caves Bonifacio

104398,Portugal,"Dark in color, with spice and some concentration. The wine, though, is spoiled by volatility and a huge and unbalancing acidity. Nor is the spirit really integrated.",Quinta São Luis Vintage,84,68.0,Port,,,Port,Kopke

104439,Portugal,"No prizes from Portuguese varietal experts for guessing that this is a blend with Touriga (Nacional and Franca) and Tinta Roriz. The wine itself is rounded, soft and sweet, with sweet black plums just touched by acidity, but more about open tannins and rich, dried fruits.",Touriz,87,14.0,Estremadura,,,Portuguese Red,Casa Santos Lima
104449,Portugal,"A wine that seems weighed down by its own structure. It is all solid tannins, darkness, the fruit not really able to express itself. Powerful and concentrated, this needs more time to develop, although the direction of the wine is still problematic.",Reserva,87,55.0,Alentejano,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Carmo
104615,Portugal,"This is the last vintage of a joint venture between J M da Fonseca and Cristiano van Zeller (the 2005 is a solo production by J M da Fonseca).

104980,Portugal,"A very light-colored wine, almost rosé, typical of the Bastardo grape, which has almost disappeared in the Douro. In that sense, this is a curiosity and the farmyard taste says much of why it is rarely found.",Conceito Bastardo,84,30.0,Duriense,,,Bastardo,Conceito Vinhos
105071,Portugal,"Fresh green-apple aromas and some ripe, mango flavors, this is well rounded, showing some acidity, but more of open, fresh fruits. This is a wine that will be perfect to drink over the next few months.",Monte Alentejano,87,,Alentejano,,,Portuguese White,DFJ Vinhos
105072,Portugal,"One of the principle grapes of the Alentejo, Antão Vaz blends easily with the Arinto of neighboring Ribatejo.

105451,Portugal,"Only the second garrafeira (the name means special selection) made by the Borba cooperative, this is a serious, complex wine that wears its tannins and rich fruits lightly.

105651,Portugal,"A blend of Roupeiro, Perrum and Antão Vaz, this is a wine that shows how crisp and fresh (and light) whites from the hot Alentejo can be.

105762,Portugal,"Already showing signs of maturity, this is a full, ripe wine, with licorice and black fruit flavors, hinting also at coffee.

105776,Portugal,"In homage to a major product of the region, this wine has a cork label.

106066,Portugal,"Soft and rich, this is powerful stuff. The texture is velvety smooth, the dark tannins very much second fiddle to the superripe fruit.

106274,Portugal,"With its proportion of barrel-aged Trincadeira, this special selection has some pretensions, which are generally fulfilled.

106379,Portugal,"A densely tannic wine, dry with bitter dark cocoa and black fruit flavors. The concentration of fruit and tannin is impressive, and gives considerable complexity of fruit as it powers alongside the dryness. It needs aging for the rough edges to smooth out, probably 2–3 years.",Montes Claros Reserva,88,14.0,Alentejo,,,Portuguese Red,Adega Cooperativa de Borba
106444,Portugal,"This is an oak-aged wine full of ripe red-plum and highly toasted wood flavors. The two do not yet completely harmonize, with the burnt wood still dominating the fruit. Another year should do the trick.",Guadalupe Tinto,87,,Alentejano,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Quetzal
106447,Portugal,"This grassy, herbaceous wine is crisp and refreshing. It has citrus and orange zest notes, with texture coming from its depth of flavor and its mineral tang.",Contraste Branco,87,,Douro,,,Portuguese White,Conceito Vinhos

106587,Portugal,"It is curious how the Cabernet, presumably ripe, tastes austere. It is young, and the tannins will certainly soften, but this is a hard wine at the moment, all edges.

106665,Portugal,"All spice, juicy fruit and dry tannins, this certainly evokes the spirit of the grape.

122610,Portugal,"Both the high alcohol and the heavy bottle detract from what is a rich but balanced wine.

129634,Portugal,"Any doubts that Portugal's Alentejo region can rival many big New World wines would be dispelled by this extravagant wine.

129656,Portugal,"Aragonês (Tinta Roriz or Tempranillo) is given intense power in the Alentejo. It has sold fruits, black cherry and spice flavors, with a big shoulder of tannins and vivid acidity. A wine for aging—3 to 4 years.",Aragonês da Peceguina,90,50.0,Alentejano,,,Aragonês,Herdade da Malhadinha Nova
129666,Portugal,"It's the French wood aging that gives this wine its Plus moniker. It brings out elegant perfumes, the black fruits rich and smooth, although there is always a core of Douro dry tannins. In its richness, it is possible to see a link with Port. On the finish, though, the acidity and dry tannins remind us of table wine.",Domini Plus,91,40.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,José Maria da Fonseca
129669,Portugal,"This is the top Douro wine in the Burmester portfolio. It is appropriately firm, mineral, with tight black fruits and solid, dry tannins.

131286,Portugal,"As you might expect—but see all too rarely—this Douro table wine comes close in character to Port, with bold, blackberry fruit-filled aromas that verge on being overripe.

131898,Portugal,"The name sounds Italian, but this is made in Portugal's Douro Valley, up in the hills near the Spanish border. According to the importer, it's a blend of indigenous Códega, Viosinho and Rabigato grapes.

A long finish cements this wine's impressive quality.",Branco Reserva,90,12.0,Douro,,,White Blend,Castello d'Alba

131982,Portugal,"The estate wine from Casal Branco is impressive and structured, with dried berry fruits, dark, dry tannins and a solid structure.

132185,Portugal,"It's mainly (80%) Alicante Bouschet with 10% each Syrah and Touriga Nacional, but this wine bears something of a resemblance to Port.

132191,Portugal,"This Symington family table wine program is going well, to judge by this excellent 2003 Reserva.

133226,Portugal,"A smooth wine, brightened with flavors of William pear, a zest of lime and a light touch of vanilla. It has attractive acidity, the fruit sitting well with the freshness.",Monte Alentejano Branco,87,8.0,Alentejano,,,Portuguese White,DFJ Vinhos
133382,Portugal,"Even for a ruby, this is dark purple in color and attractively saturated in the glass. It's somewhat grapy, but avoids simplicity by blending in hints of mulberries, chocolate and spice. Full-bodied and slightly tannic, it shows good grip for a basic ruby, although a touch of heat does show through on the finish. Not available in the U.S.",Ruby Special Reserve,88,40.0,Port,,,Port,Porto Solene
133385,Portugal,"A round, lushly fruited vintage Port, the 2000 Rozès boasts scents of toffee, chocolate and prune, then follows up with flavors of chocolate fudge and dark plum. Has enough structure to age another 10 years, just lacks a little length on the finish. Imported by Vranken America.",Vintage,88,90.0,Port,,,Port,Rozes
133397,Portugal,"A touch deeper and richer than the regular bottling, this reserva features scents of plum, cola and earth to start, then shows off an ample, soft texture in the mouth. Flavors are rich and loamy, with flecks of bright fruit that shine through. Round, mouthfilling and easy to drink.",Reserva,88,15.0,Douro,,,Red Blend,Andreza
133400,Portugal,"Surprisingly light in body, a result of this wine's elegantly wrought balance between acid and sugar.

Long on the finish, where it folds in nutty notes.",15 year Medium Rich,88,34.0,Madeira,,,Bual,Cossart Gordon
133411,Portugal,"A firmly dry wine, driven by the dark tannins, only opening slowly to give ripe berry fruits. The soft side of the wine does bring out the lighter nature of the Baga in the blend, which has been tamed by wood aging. There is a final flourish of fresh black plum juice.",Quinta das Baceladas,90,26.0,Bairrada,,,Portuguese Red,Caves Aliança
133430,Portugal,"Made jointly by Filipa Pato and her husband William, a blend of Encruzado from Dão and Bical from Bairrada, and cask fermented.

133431,Portugal,"Its dark color promises power, and this wine delivers a broad, chunky Shiraz, with perfumed fruit, dark tannins and a spicy wood structure.

133437,Portugal,"You want big, bold flavors, plenty of spicy wood? It's all here inside the heavyweight bottle.

Give it 2–3 years.",,90,29.0,Estremadura,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Boição
133438,Portugal,"The Dão's very own white variety, Encruzado gives a citric, bright lime and grapefruit wine, with a delicious bite of pear skin.

133482,Portugal,"Already showing signs of maturity, this is a full, ripe wine, with licorice and black fruit flavors, hinting also at coffee.

133496,Portugal,"In homage to a major product of the region, this wine has a cork label. It has considerable power, an old-fashioned, astringent wine that keeps the typical ultradry tannins as a sign of its ability to age. The fruit is definitely in second place here, although there are concentrated black fruits in the background. Age for 3–4 years.",Reserva,89,14.0,Alentejo,,,Portuguese Red,Adega Cooperativa de Borba

133685,Portugal,"This medium-bodied blend of Touriga Nacional (45%), Touriga Franca (35%) and Tinta Roriz (20%) lacks a bit of flesh, but you wouldn't call it lean, either.

133738,Portugal,"It is called Point West because Estremadura's vineyards are the furthest west in Europe. The wine itself is soft and fruity initially, but then there is a tight tannic texture, followed by black currant fruits. The wine is finely made, elegant, just on the warm side of cool.",Point West,89,11.0,Estremadura,,,Touriga Nacional,DFJ Vinhos
133743,Portugal,"A finely balanced wine, uniting toast and wood flavors with ripe plums in a harmonious whole. There are spice, soft tannins and light acidity. Elegant rather than powerful, this is an excellent food wine.",Conde de Vimioso,89,12.0,Ribatejano,,,Portuguese Red,Falua
133751,Portugal,"A fine, firm, structured wine that shows richness along with elegance.

134069,Portugal,"A densely tannic wine, dry with bitter dark cocoa and black fruit flavors. The concentration of fruit and tannin is impressive, and gives considerable complexity of fruit as it powers alongside the dryness. It needs aging for the rough edges to smooth out, probably 2–3 years.",Montes Claros Reserva,88,14.0,Alentejo,,,Portuguese Red,Adega Cooperativa de Borba

134128,Portugal,"From 40-year-old vines, with the grape trodden by foot in open fermenters, this is almost Port-like in its richness.

134250,Portugal,"From a mix of old indigenous white grapes, this wine reveals a producer making a stab at something different with character.

134255,Portugal,"Very perfumed and floral on the nose, with spicy, lychee notes that almost suggest Gewürztraminer, but don't have the same weight or unctuous feel on the palate.

134258,Portugal,"This is a fun, bouncy wine that actually seems a bit Syrah-like.

Perfect for casual grilling.",Colheita Seleccionada,86,12.0,Douro,,,Red Blend,Castello d'Alba
134265,Portugal,"This ambitious wine from the south of Portugal blends Alicante Bouschet, Aragonês, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, then covers much of the nuance with a veil of charred oak. Tarry, meaty, cedary notes on the nose; some cola, coffee and beet flavors. Woody on the finish. Hold 2–3 years and hope the impact of the wood lessens over time.",Reserva,86,39.0,Alentejano,,,Red Blend,Dona Maria
134268,Portugal,"Reasonably complex for a modestly priced table wine, with intriguing notes of wintergreen, birchbeer, mushrooms and beet root.

134271,Portugal,"Dark-fruited and earthy, with cedar and coffee shadings that give the wine an even darker demeanor.

Sturdy rather than charming.",Tinto Reserva,86,12.0,Douro,,,Red Blend,Castello d'Alba
134283,Portugal,"A fine, elegant wood-aged wine. It has ripe fruits, sweet peach, apricot, mango, while the vanilla of toast lifts all the flavors, adding spicy smoothness. Acidity comes from fresh lime. It could do with some aging, maybe 2–3 years.",Escolha Branco,89,19.0,Bucelas,,,Arinto,Quinta do Boição
134284,Portugal,"An exotic blend including Pinot Noir and Merlot along with Portuguese varieties, taking its name from two local villages with saint's names. It has acidity and an awkward bitter edge, with tough black fruits. Maybe it needs time for the wine to soften and meld with the tight acidity.",,89,25.0,Bairrada,,,Pinot Noir,Campolargo

134299,Portugal,"An elegant style, the ripe fruit restrained and kept in check by the dry tannins and acidity.

134354,Portugal,"Ripe and smooth, balancing dense black fruit flavors with spice, wood and acidity, this is a solid, concentrated wine.

134355,Portugal,"All spice, juicy fruit and dry tannins, this certainly evokes the spirit of the grape.

134406,Portugal,"Inky black in color, this is the top wine from Apegadas, a big, chunky wine that is characterized by dark tannins, bold berry fruits, sweet plums, but also a serious, more austere character to allow it to age.

134411,Portugal,"A blend of Chardonnay and Maria Gomes, here is a ripe wood- and apricot-flavored wine. It is full, spicy, livened by crispness from a red apple skin texture.

134576,Portugal,"Bairrada's difficult grape, the Baga, needs time for aging, which is what has happened here. The result is a wine that is fragrant, not heavy, poised and fresh.

135019,Portugal,"Two talented winemakers, Sandra Tavares da Silva and Jorge Serôdio Borges, jointly produce wines under the Wine & Soul label.

142981,Portugal,"Vincent Bouchard, owner of Tedo, divides his time between the Douro and Napa Valley. This small property is located where the River Tedo joins the Douro, downriver from Pinhão. This wine is still young, dominated by fresh black fruits, firm tannins and layers of dryness. It is certainly destined for a 15 year aging.",Traditional Single Quinta Port,89,,Douro,,,Port,Quinta do Tedo
142990,Portugal,"We don't see much white Port in this country, but in Portugal it's often served as an apéritif. This is a fine example, a little sweet but also possessing bracing acidity for balance. Mouthwatering aromas and flavors run toward nuts and stone fruits, with a hint of honey.",Fine,88,14.0,Douro,,,White Port,Ramos-Pinto
142991,Portugal,"From a small parcel of old vines, this wine is dense, very firm and closed. It is in a dry style, layering richness rather than sweetness, with solid black fruit. Give this wine at least 10 years.",Savedra Vintage Port,88,55.0,Douro,,,Port,Quinta do Tedo
142995,Portugal,"Entirely amber colored, this has taken on many qualities of a fine old tawny, boasting aromas of toffee and citrus peel, flavors that include nuts and maple syrup. The fruit is tired, but the wine still shows beautiful tawny character. Drink up.",Vintage,88,,Port,,,Port,Cockburn's
142996,Portugal,"This seems lighter in weight than expected, despite an impressively dark, saturated color. Lots of cherries and dried spices on the palate, along with aromas of walnuts and smoked meat. “Passing through some middle-age disturbances,” as Côrte-Real said, or just very good Port, not great? Hold.",Vintage Porto,88,,Port,,,Port,Cockburn's
143163,Portugal,"Not an intense or concentrated wine, perhaps, but this Reserve Port from Churchill's is well balanced and finely structured. There are flavors of green figs that give it freshness, and a dry aftertaste. A slight stalky flavor is the only off note.",Finest Vintage Character,86,17.0,Port,,,Port,Churchill's
143254,Portugal,"Situated in the heart of the Pinhão Valley, Estanho began to produce good vintage Port in the 1990s. This 1996 shows the style well. Big and ripe, quite dry with acidity and solid tannins, it is built for long aging.",Vintage Port,88,28.0,Douro,,,Port,Quinta do Estanho
143266,Portugal,"This deliciously nutty tawny has old wood and concentrated flavors. They balance against fresh, sweet fruit and coffee flavors, along with some acidity and elegance.",10-year old Tawny Port,88,37.0,Douro,,,Port,Quinta de la Rosa
143269,Portugal,"Traditional unfiltered LBV, which has richness and concentration. Flavors of raisins and ripe, fresh fruit suggest this will evolve in the bottle over the next four or five years.",Late Bottled Vintage Port,88,14.0,Douro,,,Port,Quinta do Crasto
143344,Portugal,"Rounded, rich, and very drinkable now. It is so attractive because the tannins are muted and soft. The perfumes float above the sweet red fruits, and lightly jammy character.",,87,,Port,,,Port,Quinta da Pacheca
143460,Portugal,"This comes from Quinta do Portal, well known for its Douro table wines. It is a fine, concentrated Port which shows tannins, fresh fruit and flavors of cherries. It is spoilt by the stalky aromas, but the taste is good compensation.",Cellar Reserve,86,,Port,,,Port,Portal
143468,Portugal,"A big chocolaty wine, packed with intense, almost overpowering ripe fruit. Dark cocoa flavors and big black, jammy fruit leave very little to the imagination, and make it one-dimensional. But for those who like power, here it is.",Special Reserve,86,15.0,Port,,,Port,J. H. Andresen
143471,Portugal,"Amber-colored, with a green tinge to the rim, this is a medium-weight, not-terribly-sweet Madeira imbued with flavors of walnuts and dried figs. Lots of acidity on the finish.",Alvada 5 Year Old Rich,86,15.0,Madeira,,,Madeira Blend,Blandy's
143472,Portugal,"Very nice Vinho Verde, with fresh, green apple and lime aromas and a clean, crisp finish. Maybe a little fuller and plumper than typical, but still balanced, with no shortage of apple and citrus fruit.",,86,9.0,Vinho Verde,,,White Blend,Casa de Vila Verde
143475,Portugal,"One of the most familiar of Reserve Port brands, this is a fruity, soft wine, which seems to have aging potential as well as present drinking pleasure. The flavors are open, generous, easy, with just a touch of tannin to give it structure. A definite success.",Founder's Reserve,86,17.0,Port,,,Port,Sandeman
143477,Portugal,"Immediately striking, with bold musk and floral aromas that burst from the glass. Ripe, expansive melon and spice notes on the palate. Full-bodied and soft; not as refreshing as some vintages, but still a nice way to start a meal. Drink now.",,85,13.0,Terras do Sado,,,Muscat,João Pires
143484,Portugal,"Freshness and fruitiness are the hallmarks of this wine, from French-owned Noval. It is easy and simple, but some herbal flavors add an edge of interest and there is structure as well. The bitter aftertaste spoils the rest of the wine.",LB Finest Reserve,85,18.0,Port,,,Port,Noval
143558,Portugal,"This is a big, burly wine that needs some time to come into its own. Right now, the nose is way ahead of the palate, boasting smoky, herbal complexity layered over toast and blackberries, while the flavors are harder to read, being dominated by wood. A few years of cellaring should see the oak flavors integrating more with the underlying berries. Try in 2007.",Reserva,88,40.0,Alentejano,,,Red Blend,Quinta do Carmo
143559,Portugal,"This great quinta is owned by the Ferreira family and was the former home of the legendary table wine, Barca Velha. This 2001 is a great example of the power of the wines from this sun-baked vineyard. Young black fruits are balanced with perfumes and tarry flavors. It's dark, intense and likely to be long lasting.",Vintage Port,88,35.0,Douro,,,Port,Quinta do Vale Meão
143568,Portugal,"Clearly made with lofty aims, this wine displays great intensity. The aromas of fresh-sawn wood and vanilla are nearly overpowering, while the fruit is concentrated and plummy, with a large dose of tannins that dry out the finish. Give it a few years to settle down and it will be more approachable and hopefully more complex as well.",Colheita Seleccionada,87,45.0,Alentejo,,,Aragonês,Francisco Nunes Garcia
143575,Portugal,"Pricey for a Vinho Verde, but one of the best we've tasted on this side of the Atlantic. It's lean and minerally, with hints of green apple, lime and fresh fennel. Finishes long and crisp, with a mineral note that lingers gracefully.",,87,15.0,Vinho Verde,,,Alvarinho,Portal do Fidalgo
143577,Portugal,"Richly fruity, with aromas of raspberries and cherries, joined by leathery complexities and a hint of vanilla. This is a fresh, easy-drinking wine with enough crispness and tannic structure to stand up to roast pork. Picks up intriguing smoky, meaty notes on the finish.",Ardosino,87,22.0,Douro,,,Red Blend,Quinta da Carvalhosa
143640,Portugal,"Surprisingly light and soft, for a Dow Port, this shows sweet fruit with a super-ripe edge. In the medium-term, this will be a pleasant, ripe vintage, but it's not likely to age.",Quinta da Senhora da Ribeira Vintage,87,60.0,Port,,,Port,Dow's
143659,Portugal,"A joint venture with the van Zeller and Symington families, this is a surprisingly airy, light wine which seems to miss weight and depth. Sweetness, black figs, lean.",Vintage,87,54.0,Port,,,Port,Quinta de Roriz
143734,Portugal,"A jammy, herbal flavored wine, which is well enough balanced but seems to lack much intensity. The fruit is soft, sweet with black jam flavors and a light touch of acidity. With just an extra touch of concentration, this would be a classic wine. The name of the wine comes from the principal quinta owned by Barros near Pinhão.",Vintage Character,85,,Port,,,Port,Vista Alegre
143736,Portugal,"This fresh, fruity wine comes from one of the Symington Group's second labels, one which often impresses by its quality. This Port is herbal, with chocolate flavors, black fruits and a good, clean, dry aftertaste.",Lodge Reserve,85,16.0,Port,,,Port,Smith Woodhouse
143738,Portugal,"Sweet, soft and light, this is an enjoyable, but discreet wine, hiding its charms under fresh perfumes and juicy, young fruit. After the first taste, it opened up in its glass, and showed good black fruit aromas and direct, ripe fruit flavors.",Quinta das Heredias Ruby Special Reserve,85,,Port,,,Port,Senhora do Convento
143739,Portugal,"Lime and chalk dust aromas ease into flavors of green apples and minerals. Finishes with mild citrus flavors that seem a bit softer than usual for this wine, giving it an atypically plump mouthfeel.",,85,9.0,Bucelas,,,Arinto,Quinta da Romeira
143747,Portugal,"Starts with dusty earth scents alongside black plums, then develops flavors of chocolate and earth as well. Supple and fleshy, with little in the way of tannin, just a slightly tart edge to the finish to keep things in balance.",Ruby,85,14.0,Port,,,Port,Poças
143748,Portugal,"This wine from the single quinta Quinta do Tedo, owned by Napa-based Vincent Bouchard, is sweet and soft, but has good flavors of raisins and a solid structure. The black fruit tastes are fresh, juicy and lively. A classic, easy drinking Reserve style.",Finest Reserve,85,,Port,,,Port,Quinta do Tedo
143835,Portugal,"Already throwing considerable sediment and possessed of a creamy, supple mouthfeel, this is a vintage Port that should probably be consumed young. Enjoy its lush blueberry fruit, chocolate and spice complexity over the next 10 years. Imported by Supreme Wines & Spirits.",Vintage,92,50.0,Port,,,Port,Quinta de Ventozelo
143836,Portugal,"Still in the flush of youth, this creamy-textured vintage Port strikes all the right notes, from complex aromas to powerful flavors.

144029,Portugal,"An easy drinking, ready to drink Port, with few pretensions. But it is soft and pleasant enough, with its flavors of gum arabic and soft, rich fruit. Some bitterness in the aftertaste lets the wine down.",Special Reserve,84,,Port,,,Port,Barros
144151,Portugal,"A light wine, very floral, with aromas of honeysuckle. The dry tannins behind don't quite seem to match all these perfumes. But there is fresh fruit, and simple structure.",,87,,Port,,,Port,Quinta da Romaneira
144249,Portugal,"Earthy and a bit simple, with modest dried-fruit flavors and hints of candied orange peel. Lacks concentration, making it seem a little warm on the finish, but it's a solid performer in its class.",Tawny,84,14.0,Port,,,Port,Poças
144250,Portugal,"Roederer-Champagne owned Ramos Pinto has produced a soft, easy and ripe Reserve. Aromas of cistus flowers are off-putting, but the flavors of sweet milk chocolate are attractive. It just lacks structure.",Reserva Collector,84,19.0,Port,,,Port,Ramos-Pinto
144257,Portugal,"This is a dry style of wine, with a touch of cistus aroma and lean acidity. There are good tannins, some fresh black fruits, but it needs more intensity to really show up the herbal flavors. One of the many brand names of the Barros group, Feist has a history dating back to the 1830s.",Vintage Character,84,,Port,,,Port,Feist
144268,Portugal,"Smells a bit underripe, with weedy, green notes that ride atop sour cherries. Tart and sour-tasting, yet it does pick up an intriguing licorice note on the finish. Not bad, but not worthy of its reputation.",Vinha do Fojo,84,51.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta do Fojo
144494,Portugal,"A prodigious effort from a small house that's becoming one of the Douro's best. The fruit is massive; huge and inky and filled with blackberries and chocolate. Yet for all its size, it finishes with finesse-filled layers of flavor that fold in mint and black pepper notes.",Vintage Port,97,80.0,Portugal,,,Port,Niepoort
144497,Portugal,"One of the vintage's standouts, the 2000 Quinta do Noval is incredibly rich and intense, with a density that made me think I should reach for a spoon. Chocoate and coffee, prune and date aromas; plum cake flavors. Despite the richness, there is a superb backbone of acidity and ripe tannins that suggests peak maturity is probably two decades or more away.",Vintage,95,65.0,Port,,,Port,Quinta do Noval
144572,Portugal,"The wine is perfumed with violets and a touch of nutmeg, but that is counterbalanced by its stalkiness. To taste, it is soft, but rather green and lightweight. It is pleasant enough, but doesn't have much character.",Hutcheson Porto Rocha Vintage Character,83,17.0,Port,,,Port,Barros
144580,Portugal,"A disappointing wine from such a distinguished name, spoilt by greenness, and lacking richness or depth. It certainly tastes young, so it could develop but in weight it feels almost like a table wine, not a Port.",Trademark Finest Reserve,83,17.0,Port,,,Port,Dow's
144586,Portugal,"A pleasant, straightforward aromatic wine which is given a dark side by herbs and a slight touch of bitterness. Eucalyptus and stalkiness don't quite come together.",Reserva,83,15.0,Port,,,Port,Quinta de Ventozelo
144592,Portugal,"A very light style, with raisins, currants and mature fruit flavors. There are sweetness, softness and a touch of acidity, leaving a clean, light aftertaste.",Barão de Massarelos Ruby Reserve,83,,Port,,,Port,Kopke
144598,Portugal,"This Port from the organically farmed Casal dos Jordões certainly has pure fruit flavors. But the main impression is of a green, herbal character with bitter chocolate which spoil the balance. The spirit could be better integrated, as well.",Finest Reserve,82,,Port,,,Port,Casal dos Jordões
144784,Portugal,"Perhaps the best young Churchill's I've tasted, the 2000 blends complexity with structure to create an eminently ageable Port.

144786,Portugal,"Made from grapes that used to go into Barca Velha, Portugal's most-storied table red, this wine represents the New Wave of Douro wines.

Blackberries, coffee and dried spices on the palate; it finishes long and firm, with hints of licorice.",,93,65.0,Douro,,,Red Blend,Quinta do Vale Meão
144787,Portugal,"This dense wine is packed with fruit. The blackberry and anise aromas give an impression of the wine's impressive size that is confirmed on the palate. This seems sweeter than most vintages of Dow's flagship wine, but the extra sugar is balanced by big tannins. This is one single-quinta Port that doesn't seem destined for early drinking. Try in 2015.",Senhora da Ribeira Vintage Porto,92,50.0,Douro,,,Port,Dow's
144796,Portugal,"Richly textured, verging on opulent, this should be a relatively early-maturing Port. Complex and intriguing on the nose, where smoky, minerally aromas evoke memories of sun-baked Douro schist, backed by plush blackberry fruit and a dash of maple syrup. Best from 2010.",Vintage Porto,92,48.0,Douro,,,Port,Quinta de Roriz
144991,Portugal,"Plummy on the nose, with the ripe aromas accented by hints of dried flowers. In the mouth, the texture is rich—almost syrupy—and the flavors head toward prune and chocolate fudge, finishing on drier, more complex notes of cocoa powder and spice. Imported by Kobrand.",LBV,90,25.0,Port,,,Port,Fonseca
145084,Portugal,"This lushly fruity Port folds in enough intriguing floral aromas to be more than a simple fruit bomb. Briary notes add another element to the creamy boysenberry flavors that are incredibly rich but not cloying or syrupy. Likely to mature early but hold well, thanks to masses of supple tannins. Great quality for the price.",Vintage Porto,92,45.0,Douro,,,Port,Quinta do Vale Meão
145091,Portugal,"Starts off a bit floral and toasty, but the blueberry-scented fruit quickly asserts itself. Masses of soft, ripe fruit come through on the palate, along with a rich, dense, mouthfeel and soft but plentiful tannins.",,91,43.0,Dão,,,Touriga Nacional,Casa de Santar
145095,Portugal,"Effectively a 25-year-old tawny, this wine starts off slowly, with restrained aromas of nuts and dried fruit. Then it caresses the palate with silky, lush, honeyed flavors of walnuts, oranges, cinnamon and clove, building to a crescendo on the long, anise-tinged finish.",Colheita Bottled 2002,91,75.0,Port,,,Port,Barros
145098,Portugal,"Luis Pato's Bairradas used to be the standouts of the D.O. In a sense they still are, although he has chosen to label them with the regional denomination of Beiras in protest over restrictive practices. In this example, Pato has harnessed the rough tannins and brash acidity of Baga into a rich creamy wine filled with blackberries and anise. It's still tannic and crisp, but it just needs another 10 years in the cellar to become fully appreciable.",Quinta do Moinho Baga,91,60.0,Beiras,,,Baga,Luis Pato
145385,Portugal,"Nutty and caramelly, this is a great example of aged tawny. Roasted walnut aromas waft from the glass, followed by flavors reminiscent of maple syrup carried across the palate on creamy-soft waves of richness.",20 Years Old Tawny Port,91,50.0,Port,,,Red Blend,Cockburn's
145386,Portugal,"A lighter (though not to say light), more floral style of vintage Port, with ethereal aromatics buttressed by blackberries and caramel. Finishes with bright acids and supple tannins that make it almost drinkable already. Try in 2008 and beyond.",Vintage Port,91,70.0,Portugal,,,Port,Quinta do Passadouro
145387,Portugal,"A brooding nose of sullen blackberries and earth presages a wine that shows wonderful balance between fruit, alcohol, acidity and tannin. It's not a huge, extracted Port, but one that carries itself with grace, finishing with good length and soft tannins. Drink 2010–2030.",Vintage Porto,91,56.0,Douro,,,Port,Quinta do Vesuvio
145402,Portugal,"Sappy and intense on the nose, with cherries, blackberries and toast. Although some tasters used to the lush midpalates of New World wines may find this a little lacking in that department, it comes across as smooth and supple, with finely etched fruit flavors elegantly framed by oak.",,90,18.0,Dão,,,Touriga Nacional,Adega Cooperativa de Vila Nova de Tazem
145405,Portugal,"Portuguese-owned Port houses, such as Barros, have long made terrific tawnies. This version is smoky and minerally, with nuts and citrus peel. It's supple and not very sweet, with a freshness and vibrancy that belie its age. Peppery on the finish.",20 Years Old,90,35.0,Port,,,Port,Barros
145685,Portugal,"A reasonably good buy in vintage Port, Silval is something of a second label for Quinta do Noval. It's less concentrated and suppler in the mouth than its sister wine, but still boasts compelling floral aromas allied to prune, berry and chocolate flavors. Worth trying a bottle before 2010.",Silval Vintage,90,37.0,Port,,,Port,Quinta do Noval
145687,Portugal,"Intentionally made in a friendly, fruit-forward style, Vau doesn't disappoint in 2000.

145691,Portugal,"A selection of lots not deemed worthy of inclusion in this estate's flagship red, Meandro is nevertheless a fine wine and an even better value.

Drink now–2008.",Meandro,90,19.0,Douro,,,Red Blend,Quinta do Vale Meão
145694,Portugal,"Barros's tawnies are worth seeking out. This young example shows the house's signature smoky, nutty aromas but adds more fruity scents of raisins and prunes. Supple in the mouth, with a long, toffee-filled finish.",10 Years Old,90,25.0,Port,,,Port,Barros
145702,Portugal,"Toast and vanilla notes from oak barrels are layered over aromas of cured meat and blackberries. On the palate, it's lush but not overly weighty or rich, just nicely balanced. There's plenty of spicy oak, especially on the finish, but also the fruit to support it.",Carm Reserva,90,23.0,Douro,,,Touriga Nacional,Roberedo Madeira
145704,Portugal,"This young vintage Port is quite big, with plenty of lush fruit and some herb and spice notes. It's also on the dry side for vintage Port, and it lacks the hulking tannins you might expect. Surprisingly ready to drink, even at this age.",Vintage,90,54.0,Port,,,Port,Quinta do Portal

145916,Portugal,"This blend of Alfrochiero, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional is a steal at the $7 price.

146000,Portugal,"A big, burly wine with a firmly tannic finish, the 1999 Praemium needs a few years to shed its youthfulness.

146001,Portugal,"Plums, dusty earth and dried spice mingle on the nose of this older release that actually seems more ageworthy than Portal's 1997 and 1999.

146003,Portugal,"You get a glimpse of the fine qualities of the 1997 vintage in this bottling, which displays lush black cherry and plum aromas and flavors against a backdrop of supple tannins and a velvety texture. The elements are well integrated, and the finish is long and fruity.",LBV Porto,89,18.0,Portugal,,,Port,Dow's

146689,Portugal,"With its charming aromas of spice drop, ripe cherries and schistous minerality, this Taylor looks set to zoom.

Pleasant plum and black-cherry flavors emerge with time, but the real story here is the finish, which is show-stopping: long, multifaceted and intense.",Barca Velha,90,80.0,Douro,,,Red Blend,Casa Ferreirinha
147694,Portugal,"There's plenty of oak here, evidenced by the dominant chocolate and vanilla aromas, but there's also good fruit backing it up. Raspberries and cranberries provide a welcome counterpoint to the oak and extend through the long finish.",Reserva,89,22.0,Douro,,,Red Blend,Quinta do Crasto
147707,Portugal,"Slight cherry fruit is hanging in, but the emphasis here is on mushrooms, damp earth and forest-floor elements. The attenuated, tart cherry fruit provides a nice counterpoint to the earthy components in this mature, ready-to-drink wine.",Reserva,87,46.0,Douro,,,Red Blend,Casa Ferreirinha
147708,Portugal,"Subtle smoke shadings color the predominantly blackberry and chocolate aromas before yielding to plum and black-cherry fruit flavors.

147843,Portugal,"This Douro red speaks clearly of its origins, blending anise and mineral notes with ripe fruit. Resin and spice notes add interest to the black cherry flavors, backed by just a hint of toasty oak. Structured and firm, this wine could use a bit more lushness and flesh, but nicely conveys its sense of place. Imported by Supreme Wines & Spirits.",Tinto,87,15.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Quinta de Ventozelo
147899,Portugal,"Shows some of the weakness of the vintage in its rather tart profile and flavors of red fruits and cranberries. A good effort, just short of the usual standard at this estate.",Vinho Tinto,86,14.0,Douro,,,Red Blend,Quinta do Crasto
148007,Portugal,"Less lush and welcoming than the other LBVs reviewed for this issue, C. da Silva's Presidential brand instead shows more acidity and tannin.

148173,Portugal,"Always one of the best 20-year-olds, and this is no exception. The secret is in the velvet-like smoothness, which combines with a balanced mix of fig and caramel flavors, just a touch of burnt vanilla and the sort of acidity that makes you want another glass. Delicious.",Duque de Bragança 20-year old tawny,94,70.0,Port,,,Port,Ferreira
148176,Portugal,"A superbly dense, concentrated wine so rich in flavor that it almost has a brooding, dark quality.

148183,Portugal,"As so often, Niepoort comes through with a fabulous wine. It is dry and structured, with mature flavors that suggest there are wines in the blend that are older than 10 years.

148184,Portugal,"At first taste, this appears amazingly fresh for a 40-year-old, but then the older flavors kick in. There is concentration, ripeness and huge intensity of flavor. It's a beautiful wine, with dried apricots giving freshness. Imported by Pernod Ricard.",40-year old tawny,93,135.0,Port,,,Port,Sandeman
148192,Portugal,"A dark, concentrated wine, very impressive. But with all this concentration, there is also sweet fruit, flavors of apricots that have been bottled in spirits.

148308,Portugal,"Powered with acidity and its firm structure, this is an intensely dry, concentrated, powerful wine.

148316,Portugal,"This is an impressive wine, all power and concentration. Flavors of bitter chocolate and arabica coffee are balanced with citrusy freshness. It's relatively lively and vibrant, but there are also plenty of mature flavors.",20-year old tawny,92,42.0,Port,,,Port,Barão de Vilar
148319,Portugal,"Although part of Barros, Kopke still operates relatively independently, and obviously can draw on good stocks of aged tawnys.

148535,Portugal,"From a sun-baked region in the south, and this wine does show some of that heat in its slightly stewed fruit aromas and flavors.

148560,Portugal,"An attractively dry style of wine, with a concentrated inner core of firm acid and lightly burnt flavors. It has intensity, along with good fruitiness.

148585,Portugal,"Warre's seems to have found just the right formula for its tawnys. The 10-Year OldOtima is a fine wine, and so is this Otima 20.

148642,Portugal,"A bit of a disappointment from this winery, but the flavors here seem a touch overripe, with pruny notes intruding into the blackberries.
