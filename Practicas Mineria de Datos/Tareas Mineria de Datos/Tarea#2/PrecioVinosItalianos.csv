11799,Portugal,"While the year is not one of the great Port vintages, it has produced some finely structured wines like this that will mature relatively quickly. It comes with great fruit that was teased out of the grapes in traditional open stone lagars. It is, of course, dense and full of tannins as well as fruit. It will develop well and could be drinkable soon (say by 2018) for its fruit although it will then age for many years until 2030 and beyond.",Vintage,93,80.0,Port,,,Port,Quinta do Vale Meão

11863,France,"The full force of aromatic, dried pear rises from the glass, laced with dried apricot and candied peel. The pear fruit becomes exquisitely clear and pure on the palate, which is profound but slender. The wine is dry but powerful, holding at its core all the ripeness and fruit flavor from brilliant sunlight. It almost warms you from inside and goes on and on. Drink now till 2030.",Clos Windsbuhl,94,80.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht
11864,France,"Tender notes of citrus appear at first through a veil of yeast. Their zestiness then fills out with subtle, earthy spice. On the light, dry palate, the true subtlety hits: wafts of lemon, aromatic wild thyme, Seville orange zest, fresh apple peel and wet stone. The delicacy of the concentrated body is astonishing, with a central vein of lemony freshness that provides a focal point. So subtle, so layered and alive: with every new sip new nuances occur.",Clos Windsbuhl,94,80.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht
11867,Italy,"Pressed blue flower, ripe black-skinned berry, baking spice, tobacco and leather aromas come together on this round, full-bodied wine.

15159,US,"Pretty tannic, a wine that makes the tongue stick to the palate, although it will soften and sweeten up with big, rich roasts.

Seems to have the density and concentration to cellar for the long haul.",Quarry Vineyard,91,80.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
15166,US,"An extremely tannic and tough wine that numbs the palate despite polished plum, blackberry and dry chocolate flavors. Oak adds vanilla, smoke and a richly creamy texture. Will it age?

15171,US,"Pretty tannic, and extremely well-oaked. Char, vanilla and smoke dominate the opening aroma, only gradually revealing underlying cassis flavors.

17443,Italy,"This is a distinctly uncommon wine with delicate nuances of pressed flowers, violets, leather, spice, nutmeg and licorice that sees no wood.

17473,US,"Exceptionally ripe in black cherries, blackberries, cassis, and chocolate, and sweet in fruit juice essence, although it's technically dry.

18684,Portugal,"Gold in color, this is a wood-aged Port. Despite being 26 years old, it is still lively, almost fruity.

18780,US,"Plenty of tough mountain tannins in this classically-huge Howell Mountain Cabernet. Combined with dryness and acidity, it makes for one tough drink.

19506,US,"A thoroughly good Cabernet that represents a welcome return to form after a disappointing period for the winery in the mid-2000s.

Could easily score even higher down the road.",Villa Vista,94,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kuleto Estate

It's a big, tannic and dry wine, stuffed with blackberry, currant and oak flavors. Voluptuous and dramatic, but it needs age, possibly a lot.

23985,US,"Three things characterize this wine: exceptionally intense blackberry and currant flavors, thick, hard tannins and a bone dry finish.

24164,US,"One of the richest Cabernets of the vintage. Amazingly soft and velvety in the mouth, yet there's a solid grip of acidity and tannins that balance the richness. The flavors are extraordinary, ranging from blackberry and cherry-pie filling through currant liqueur and milk chocolate to leather.

24280,US,"For sheer palate seduction, you can't beat this rich wine. It used to be that Diamond Mountain Cabs weren't drinkable for years because of the tannins. Not so with this beauty. It shows pure, classic Cabernet flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherry-pie filling, violets and sweet, smoky sandalwood, with a distinct minerality.

47721,US,"It will be fascinating to taste this wine in six, eight, ten years. Right now, it's big, thick, dry and powerful.

47953,Argentina,"Different than past Chacayes wines in that it's more floral and exotic, and less about pure power.

Drink now through 2014.",Chacayes,92,80.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,François Lurton
48023,Italy,"Rotondo is a gorgeous wine that boasts intensity, integration and complexity.

48228,US,"The challenge with a Chardonnay this big is to wrestle the power into submissive balance. As it is, the wine is overwhelming in buttery new oak and awesomely ripe pineapple and apricot fruit. It's almost undrinkable now. However, there's a brisk streak of acidity, and It's totally dry, with a stony minerality, like a lick of steel. Try cellaring for 3–4 years.",Pastorale Vineyard,92,80.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Freestone
48229,US,"Lots of acidity in this young wine, maybe more than some wine lovers will be comfortable with. That gives the enormously ripe cherry and persimmon fruit a bite, and could help this dry, silky wine to develop in the cellar. It's of a piece with the 2007 and 2008.

49443,US,"Enormously ripe, as you'd expect from this famous vineyard. Explodes in red cherries, licorice, cola, anise and smoky sandalwood, so rich and deep and long in the finish.

52569,Chile,"The price for one of Chile's flagship wines keeps climbing, but fortunately so does the quality. Winemaker Enrique Tirado has crafted yet another pounding, saturated Cabernet. It's wonderfully meshed yet potent and fierce. Boysenberry, cassis and kirsch flavors control the extracted palate, while the finish is warm, creamy and fun, sort of like a milkshake.

61321,US,"This is one of the larger, more imponderable Pinots I've tasted this year, meaning that it has the heft of something from the Rhône, perhaps a Grenache, although it never loses Pinot's silkiness. It's tremendous and forward in jammy cherries, raspberries and cola, and while it's dry, it has the sweet finish of an extremely ripe wine.

69018,US,"The flagship of Krug's new Limited Release offerings, IX Clones refers to the nine different clones of Cabernet Sauvignon that comprise this wine. The result is more complexity than in the ""regular"" Limited Release Cab and a firmer, chewier finish that suggests cellaring 4-7 years prior to consumption. It's full and creamy-textured on the palate, with aromas and flavors that hint at smoke, cassis, tobacco, cedar and a multitude of dried spices. Should be great, starting in 2010. Only problem?

69695,US,"This is Terre Rouge's priciest Syrah, a barrel selection of the best lots. It's a big wine. No, make that huge. Godzilla-esque. Just explodes in the mouth with massive flavors of blackberry and black cherry jam, milk chocolate, anise, cedar and pepper.

83478,Italy,"There's a warm, yeasty quality to this bright sparkling blend (with Chardonnay and Pinot Nero) from northern Italy. It is redolent of apricot, toasted almond, freshly baked bread and dried roses. In the mouth, it shows a drying feel and piquant, fresh bubbling.",Gran Cuvée Pas Opere,92,80.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,,Sparkling Blend,Bellavista
83613,US,"Aloof and resistant, this Pinot is almost rustic. The vineyard is at the coolest “deep end” of Anderson Valley, and the chilly vintage has accentuated the acids and tannins. There's a complex core of flavor, however, suggesting cherries, pomegranates, sautéed wild mushrooms and cured meats. All indications are of ageability; give it 68 years in a proper cellar.",The Narrows Vineyard Estate Grown,93,80.0,California,Anderson Valley,Mendocino/Lake Counties,Pinot Noir,Goldeneye
84057,US,"Here's one for the cellar, guaranteed. It shows all the classic hallmarks of an ageworthy Napa Cabernet. Dry, tannic and closed, with massively concentrated blackberry and cassis flavors, and a firm grounding of minerals. Very fine and complex, very impressive.

84334,US,"Gorgeous, opulent, intense, a really impressive Cabernet right out of the bottle.

84636,US,"A thoroughly good Cabernet that represents a welcome return to form after a disappointing period for the winery in the mid-2000s.

84771,US,"A quintessential, cult-style Napa Cabernet, this has a soft creaminess that's reminiscent of milk chocolate.

84901,US,"Part of a Limited Release series, this may be both the most expensive and most alcoholic Cabernet ever made by Chateau Ste. Michelle.

85737,France,"Dominated by toasty, mentholly oak, this is a dark, vibrant purple-hued wine that features plenty of intensity, just not a lot of midpalate richness or complexity.

85889,US,"Give this dramatic young wine a little time in the decanter or the glass to gain its stride. Right out of the bottle, it's tough as nails, but a bit of breathing softens it, bringing out a vast core of sweet black currant. Lots of new oak adds to the sweetness in the form of buttered toast.

89644,US,"This very dense, tannic Pinot Noir represents a triumph for both the winery, the vintage and the region it represents. A multi-clone blend (hence the name) with high, cool-climate acidity and aged in 100% new oak, it's still young, fresh and tight. The astringency throws a cloak over the raspberries, cherries, rosehip tea and Indian spice flavors, which reveal themselves only reluctantly.

90723,US,"This portion of the winery's vineyard always yields Cabernets of enormous concentration with hard tannins. The 2009 is a classic, detonating in the mouth with laserlike blackberry and cassis flavors, to which new oak brings additional richness of smoky cedar. It's really a beautiful wine, but very tannic, even by Von Strasser standards.

90724,US,"This has so much rich earth and minerality, it's like a journey deep into a mine. It's noted the vines were planted in 1970, and the wine does have that old-vine concentration of fruit in the form of massively intense blackberries. Then there's the smoky new oak, which adds such a lusciously sweet jacket of buttered toast. Tannic and tight in the way of Diamond Mountain Cabernets, this should begin to come into its own after 2016.",Spaulding Vineyard,95,80.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Von Strasser
90747,US,"Very pure in blackberries and black currants, this expresses the classic taste of Cabernet Sauvignon. New oak adds a lovely veneer of smoky, cedary cigar box.

92440,US,"Only a Burgundian ideologue would find anything not to like about this mouth-filling Pinot that captures the essence of Santa Rita Hills. It's as voluptuous as any Pinot in California, offering waves of ripe, fleshy cherries, red currants, licorice and smoky vanilla that just don't stop in palate appeal. For all that, the wine is elegant, silky and refined. Delicious now, although a little tannic, and will benefit from decanting and aging. Bring on the steak.",Ten,96,80.0,California,Sta.

92445,US,"The Cabernet is sharply defined, with interesting citrus flavors defining the borders of the fruit. Lemon peel, candied pineapple and even grapefruit add lovely grace notes indicative of rich, clean, natural acids and a wine with plenty of glycerin.

93650,US,"Craig's Howell Mountain Cab typically is powerful and ripe, with bigtime tannins that require aging. The 2005 is such a wine.

It has an acid backbone that nobody could crack. Very serious, with intense apple, pear and minerality. Much like a fine Burgundy.",Pedrouzos 1.5L,92,80.0,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,,Godello,Bodegas Valderroa
115042,Germany,"It's rare to see older vintages of German wines released straight from the estate cellars, so if you haven't had the chance to sample older German dessert wines, this may be worth a try. It's pretty darn good, too, with lovely clover blossom and honey scents leading into dried apricot and juicy pineapple flavors. Don't expect a thick, syrupy wine—this has a light touch and impeccable balance that might best be paired with foie gras, fresh fruit or mild cheeses rather than full-blown dessert. Reasonably priced, considering the prädikat and age.",Erdener Treppchen Beerenauslese,91,80.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,C.H. Berres
115216,France,"Made from purchased grapes (Jaboulet finally acquired 1.5 hectares of Côte-Rôtie in 2006), this is a nicely textured, creamy wine that avoids tannic overload or heaviness, allowing the floral, spicy side of the appellation to shine. Drink now–2015.",Les Jumelles,89,80.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,Syrah,Paul Jaboulet Aîné
115393,US,"What an aroma. So Côte-Rôtie, so powerful and rich, yet so refined. Masses of white pepper, cassis, freshly ground French roast, cocoa, gingersnap cookie, char, vanilla, cinnamon—and that's just the smell! In the mouth, there's all that and more. Dry, massive, deep and long. A triumph. 2008–2020.",Hayne Vineyard,94,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Petite Sirah,Turley
115717,France,"From the domaine of Pierre Morey, who is also cellarmaster at Domaine Leflaive. Like at Leflaive, he works his vines biodynamically. This is a layered wine; the pure, crisp fruit partnering with light toast flavors and a poised and structured apple-skin aftertaste.",Les Tessons,91,80.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Pierre Morey
115801,France,"For a village wine, this is impressive. The richness and ripeness of the grapes translates into a full wine with white- fruit and spice flavors. But quite properly, there is a fine, poised mineral streak from the chalk soil that gives the wine shape and balance.",,90,80.0,Burgundy,Puligny-Montrachet,,Chardonnay,Domaine Leflaive
115819,US,"Pours dark and smells youthful, with cherry, raspberry, cola and spice scents. In the mouth, it's a big wine that's stuffed with cherry pie and oak flavors. It's also fairly tannic, which should enable it to age for a few years. This is a success for the vintage.",Five Sisters,90,80.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
115984,France,"A big, fat wine that lives up to the popular image of Meursault. Perhaps it could do with a little more depth of flavor, but it's a ripe glassful of Chardonnay now.",Les Charmes Premier Cru,89,80.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Domaine Vincent Bouzereau
116262,France,"A lively, fresh and relatively light wine, showing the soft and easy side of Charmes. It is ready to drink but without the opulence of some wines from this vineyard.",Charmes Premier Cru,88,80.0,Burgundy,Meursault,,Chardonnay,Bouchard Père & Fils
116264,US,"Reminds me of the '97, a very ripe but very tannic wine that didn't offer much early on. The tannins on the '03 are bigtime astringent, locking down the palate, but oodles of ripely sweet cherry and cedar flavors tease. Best after 2008.",Three Palms Vineyard,88,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Merlot,Duckhorn
116501,US,Not even as good as the mediocre '06. Way too jammy-sweet and acidic in raspberries and cherries. More like a dessert wine than something dry for the table.,The Pointer,82,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Armanino Family Cellars
116644,Argentina,"Winemakers Hélène Garcin and Patrice Levêque have coaxed a ton of character from 70-year-old Malbec and Cabernet vines, and the result is juicy but dark, with asphalt and tar aromas sitting in front of tight but generous black fruit (cassis and blackberry). Finishing notes of coffee, mocha and char leave you happy.",Poesia,93,80.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Hélène Garcin
116752,Argentina,"Having tasted the 2002 through the 2005, the '04 seems bright by comparison, with aromatics that include forest floor, tar and lively berries. The palate, like all the Poesia wines, is mouthfilling and substantial; flavors of black cherry, boysenberry and mocha are knit together and don't skip a beat.",Poesia,92,80.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Hélène Garcin
116757,Argentina,"The youngest of the Poesia line shows some new oak in the form of sawdust aromas and espresso and mocha on the finish. In between those oak-based characteristics are mineral and black-fruit aromas as well as lush, very potent plum and berry flavors. With midnight darkness, firm tannins and straggling wood notes, we suggest sitting this bruiser down for another two to five years.",Poesia,92,80.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Hélène Garcin
116764,France,"A ripe, bold and impressive wine, showing yellow peaches and pineapple flavors to go with its tight core of minerality.

116909,Argentina,"Get by the opening notes of leather, bitter root and horseradish and what lies beneath is a top-notch Malbec-Cab Sauvignon blend that shows tons of old-vines boysenberry and cassis character. It's a bit juicy and exacting on the palate, but it's also cleansing and will never be confused for fat and misguided. A true Argentine high flier, yet the newer vintages ('03, '04 and '05) are even better.",Poesia,90,80.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Hélène Garcin
117272,Italy,"This wine towers over others in terms of excellence. This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Syrah and other varieties (that sees 14 months of barrique) is the epitome of grace and elevates wine drinking to almost spiritual heights: The nose is horizontal, wide, vast and infinite with extraordinary tobacco, leather with fine cherry at its core and toasted almond and herbal notes at the extremities. The palate is treated to soft tones of vanilla, silky tannins and overall finesse that can be savored over long minutes.",Guado al Tasso,95,80.0,Tuscany,Bolgheri Superiore,,Red Blend,Marchesi Antinori
117468,France,"True to Colombo's style, this is rather oaky, but with a few years of aging the oak has turned cedary, blending easily with iron and cassis. Long on the finish, with strong cinnamon notes. Drink now-2015.",Les Ruchets,90,80.0,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Syrah,Jean-Luc Colombo
117488,Italy,"The 17% alcohol is a bit frightening but this wine does a reasonably good job of absorbing the heat by contrasting it with strawberry preserves, moist earth, raspberry roll-up and nutty aromas (no wood is used). It does, however, boast enormous intensity in the mouth, with sweet fruit flavors. It's an “intellectual-meditation” wine, that won't appeal to everyone.",Badde Nigolosu Tenores,86,80.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Romangia,,Cannonau,Tenute Dettori
117827,France,"While the Larmandier's main vineyard is in Vertus, they also have a parcel in the grand cru vineyard of Cramant.

117936,France,"This is part of a range which returns to origins, with wood fermentation for the wines.

117978,France,Showing signs of toasty maturity. Rosé Champagne does age but it becomes much more like regular (white) Champagne.

118156,US,"Strong now in fruity flavor and oak, with potent mountain tannins, this tiny-production Cab wants some time to knit together.

Try after 2013.",Agira Vineyard,93,80.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Von Strasser
118445,US,"A beautifully rich, complex mountain wine that wants some time in the cellar. Dry and complex in tannin structure, it shows flamboyant blackberry, cherry, raspberry, chocolate, roasted almond and brown sugar flavors, as delicious as a succulent granola candy bar.

119217,US,"Here's one for the cellar, guaranteed. It shows all the classic hallmarks of an ageworthy Napa Cabernet. Dry, tannic and closed, with massively concentrated blackberry and cassis flavors, and a firm grounding of minerals. Very fine and complex, very impressive.

119347,US,"Loads of plum, dark chocolate, blackberry and exotic spices in this big, dry wine. Oak, too, in the form of exquisite vanilla and caramel. It's absolutely delicious, but maybe a little one-dimensional, showing that Petit Verdot by itself needs some help from other varieties.",,91,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Petite Verdot,Jarvis
119355,US,"This is a rich, plump young Pinot Noir. It's medium-bodied and velvety, with plum, black cherry, bacon and Indian spice flavors, and with a lovely coat of sweet, smoky sandalwood.

119494,US,"Gorgeous, opulent, intense, a really impressive Cabernet right out of the bottle.

A wine to savor now and cellar for a decade.",Frog Prince,95,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kuleto Estate
119534,US,"One of the richest Cabernets of the vintage. Amazingly soft and velvety in the mouth, yet there's a solid grip of acidity and tannins that balance the richness. The flavors are extraordinary, ranging from blackberry and cherry-pie filling through currant liqueur and milk chocolate to leather. So decadent now, it's hard to resist, but should develop for 4–6 years.",Kathryn Hall,96,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hall

119796,US,"A thoroughly good Cabernet that represents a welcome return to form after a disappointing period for the winery in the mid-2000s.

119950,US,"For sheer palate seduction, you can't beat this rich wine. It used to be that Diamond Mountain Cabs weren't drinkable for years because of the tannins. Not so with this beauty. It shows pure, classic Cabernet flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherry-pie filling, violets and sweet, smoky sandalwood, with a distinct minerality. Although it's beautiful now, it should develop in the bottle for a decade.",,93,80.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,J.R. Carter
119990,Chile,"Outstanding as always. Right from the first take it has an elevated sense of being. The nose is rich, warm and deeply fruited, with balsam wood and lemony notes.

120305,US,"A curious wine. It's not tasting at all good now. So tannic, so new oaky, it feels clumsy and astringent and awkward in the mouth. Then you realize how rich the heart of fruit is, offering an enormous array of blackberries, blueberries and black currants. The grapes are from Rutherford. The gamble is if the fruit will outlast the tannins.",Wykoff Vineyard,91,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Neal Family
120515,US,"This is Terre Rouge's priciest Syrah, a barrel selection of the best lots. It's a big wine. No, make that huge. Godzilla-esque. Just explodes in the mouth with massive flavors of blackberry and black cherry jam, milk chocolate, anise, cedar and pepper. Finishes bone dry, and the tannins are also gigantic, but very finely ground. You need to cellar this puppy.

120527,France,"This is rich, but the balance of the wine is excellent, the wood very much underneath the smooth, opulent apricot and pear fruits.

120571,Chile,"A kitchen-sink blend of five grapes produces an excellent result. Borobo blends Pinot Noir and Syrah with your standard Bordeaux varieties, and the finished product is minty and rich, with coconut, shoe polish and crusty aromas in front of syrupy, roasted flavors of brown sugar and baked berries. Toast and mocha are the finishing notes. A chunky wine to drink now.",Borobo,92,80.0,Chile,,,Red Blend,Lapostolle

120692,France,"The ripe aromas are the sign of a wine that is rich, weighty and intense. This is a vinous Champagne, rich in full-bodied yellow and white fruits, definitely suggesting rich foods.

120712,US,"This is an extraordinarily fine Cabernet Sauvignon, easily St. Supéry's best in memory. It's made in a completely different style from the prevailing cult model, being fully dry, lower in alcohol, and maintaining a tannic structure framing blackberry and currant flavors that are notably balanced with herbs and tobacco. Will get better and better. Call it Bordeaux-esque. Now–2017.",Dollarhide Limited Edition Estate,95,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,St. Supéry
120715,US,"A spectacular dessert wine. The residual sugar is 18%, making it superrich in honeyed sweetness, complexed with apricot, pineapple, pear, vanilla cream and new oak flavors of butterscotch and crème brûlée. But it's also crisp in acidity, giving it a clean scour. One of the best sweeties of the vintage.",Estate Vineyard Selection Botrytised,95,80.0,California,Chalk Hill,Sonoma,Sémillon,Chalk Hill
120862,US,"Shows a great return to form over the 2006, with the lush flavors and rich attractions of the 2005. With soft but complex tannins, the wine immediately appeals for its wealth of blackberries, black currants and plums, enriched with smoky oak. Very rich, pure and refined.

Fleshy plum, dark berries and black currant leaf abound in the bouquet, while flavors of pepper and leathery spice add intrigue to the palate.

121732,US,"Ripe, forward blackberry, cherry, currant and licorice flavors mark this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend. It's dry, and the tannins are ultrarefined. But there's an astringent feeling that shuts down the palate's appreciation of how good it is. This is a wine you want to cellar for 4–6 years.",Tribute,90,80.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Benziger
121776,Argentina,"Sweet aromas of black raisin and licorice are a good indicator of what's to come. This is one thick, jammy, softer-bodied wine that's ready to drink now.

122437,US,"Easily the best Merlot from Livermore Valley in memory, which is not a back-handed compliment. It's a bone dry, tannic wine stuffed with complex, interesting fruit, currant, herb, tobacco and cedar flavors. Really very fine, and drinkable now despite the tannins. Its longterm future is controversial, though, so open over the next 3 years.",Estate,92,80.0,California,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Merlot,Picazo
122527,US,"A gorgeous wine notable for its balance and Bordeaux-like elegance. Smoky, ashy oak dominates the aroma, just hinting at the cherry, currant and plum fruit beneath. In the mouth, the wine is firm in dusty tannins, and bright in cherry and blackberry flavors. Made from Cabernet, Merlot, Malbec and Cab Franc, this polished Bordeaux blend will be best after 2010.

122541,Australia,"This is the new icon wine from Jacob's Creek and it's a ripper, as the Aussies might say. At a reasonable 14% alcohol, it's full-bodied and lush enough to satisfy, yet restrained enough to maintain a solid sense of balance.

Drink now–2015.",Johann,92,80.0,South Australia,South Australia,,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon,Jacob's Creek
122720,US,"Kind of clunky now. Bigtime tannins make it astringent, and the fruit flavors, of blackberries and sour cherry candy coated with oak, feel ripely heavy on the palate.

123586,US,"Vintage seems to have made all the difference in this 100% Cabernet. The 2005 was rich and fat, the 2006 less so. You'll find plenty of acidity framing the juicy blackberry and black currant flavors. It seems to be very finely layered, so your best bet is to cellar it for 6–8 years and see what happens.",Winfield Vineyard,89,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,The Grade

124138,France,"There's not too much fruit going on here; the aromas and flavors tend more towards caramel, vanilla and cinnamon, with just a faint lemon tone as a backdrop.

Though impressive, this wine is a bit disjointed and could use a few years to integrate.",Grand Cru Brand,89,80.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Gris,Josmeyer
124410,US,"Ripe, almost overripe, with pie-filling flavors of cherries and blackberries that veer past currants into suggestions of raisins. Feels fat, opulent, rich, heavy, and that impression is compounded by lots of toasty, sweet oak. Dramatic, but lacks subtlety and control.

125260,US,"Only a Burgundian ideologue would find anything not to like about this mouth-filling Pinot that captures the essence of Santa Rita Hills. It's as voluptuous as any Pinot in California, offering waves of ripe, fleshy cherries, red currants, licorice and smoky vanilla that just don't stop in palate appeal. For all that, the wine is elegant, silky and refined. Delicious now, although a little tannic, and will benefit from decanting and aging. Bring on the steak.",Ten,96,80.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Sea Smoke
125265,US,"The Cabernet is sharply defined, with interesting citrus flavors defining the borders of the fruit. Lemon peel, candied pineapple and even grapefruit add lovely grace notes indicative of rich, clean, natural acids and a wine with plenty of glycerin. The stunning red fruits are polished and backed with details such as dried herb, and a tiny hint of mint.

126470,US,"Craig's Howell Mountain Cab typically is powerful and ripe, with bigtime tannins that require aging. The 2005 is such a wine. Made with a drop of Merlot, it shows black cherry and cassis fruit accented with lots of toasty new oak. But it's really young, stinging the palate with astringency. Should negotiate the next 10 years with ease.",,92,80.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Craig
126776,Argentina,"A bit warm and ripe at 15.5%, but the nose of prune, raisin and blackberry is rich and only gets better with airing.

129045,US,"A Bordeaux blend from Newton's mountain estate, this lovely wine starts out with a fat, fleshy appeal. It offers elaborate waves of sweetly smoked oak that conjoin nicely with cherry preserves, red licorice and dark chocolate.

Despite the wine's density, it possesses lightness and elegance that make it uplifting. Drink now and over the next several years.",Heirloom,95,80.0,California,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Etude
143760,Italy,"Seductive, succulent and hedonistic. This 77% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Merlot blend is incredibly forthcoming and ready to drink immedi ately thanks to its rich toasted notes, chocolate fudge, blackberry, leather, tobacco, menthol and herbal aromas. There's a ton of vanilla and sweet spice on the velvety finish and melted chocolate on the close.",Fratta,94,80.0,Veneto,Veneto,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Maculan
143767,US,"When Cosentino's clarets hit the mark, they're darn near as good as anything in the valley. This blend of Cabs Sauvignon and Franc and Merlot is wickedly good. There's a ton of oak, but it's just the perfect touch. Tastewise, it's black currants, crème de cassis and sweet Asian spices. So soft and forward; drink now.",Legends,93,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Meritage,M. Cosentino
144065,US,"It's sometimes overlooked that Jess Jackson produces very small quantities of competitive wines such as this. This 100% Cabernet is a mountain wine, dense in tannins and very dry, yet intense in classically Cabernet black currant fruit. The all new French oak feels natural. As good as it is, more refinement is necessary, but Anakota is a label worth watching.",Helena Dakota Vineyard,92,80.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Anakota
144070,US,"Mountain grapes have yielded an intense, concentrated young Cabernet, grown on the Sonoma side of Mount St. Helena. The wine is brash, dry and astringently tannic now. But it possesses a classic elegance and refinement and a remarkable core of cassis fruit. How could it not develop, given the balance and harmony? Best 2008–2015.",Helena Montana Vineyard,92,80.0,California,Knights Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Anakota
144083,Spain,"From extremely old Godello vines, this barrel-fermented wine comes only in magnums. It's currently showing a lot of oak, but it's also extremely well structured. It has an acid backbone that nobody could crack. Very serious, with intense apple, pear and minerality. Much like a fine Burgundy.",Pedrouzos 1.5L,92,80.0,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,,Godello,Bodegas Valderroa
144322,Germany,"It's rare to see older vintages of German wines released straight from the estate cellars, so if you haven't had the chance to sample older German dessert wines, this may be worth a try. It's pretty darn good, too, with lovely clover blossom and honey scents leading into dried apricot and juicy pineapple flavors. Don't expect a thick, syrupy wine—this has a light touch and impeccable balance that might best be paired with foie gras, fresh fruit or mild cheeses rather than full-blown dessert. Reasonably priced, considering the prädikat and age.",Erdener Treppchen Beerenauslese,91,80.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,,,Riesling,C.H. Berres
144494,Portugal,"A prodigious effort from a small house that's becoming one of the Douro's best. The fruit is massive; huge and inky and filled with blackberries and chocolate. Yet for all its size, it finishes with finesse-filled layers of flavor that fold in mint and black pepper notes.",Vintage Port,97,80.0,Portugal,,,Port,Niepoort
144654,Italy,"Reticent at first, the elements show their complexity and depth with time. Full and very dark, this offers plenty of black cherry and cedar aromas and flavors offset by impressive licorice and Mouton-like pencil-lead notes. Smooth on the palate, showing great balance and integration, the ripe fruit here sings through the long finish with its soft tannins, good grip and tobacco-nut-mineral-dust accents. Cellar Selection.",Tignanello,93,80.0,Tuscany,Toscana,,Sangiovese,Antinori
144900,Italy,"Antinori turns an impressive hat trick with another winning offering. Full cherry-plum and chocolate flavors display an intriguing olive-herb note. It's plush on the tongue, with round, supple tannins; the black fruit and tobacco flavors flow effortlessly into the long finish with its full, mouth-coating tannins.",Guado al Tasso,91,80.0,Tuscany,Bolgheri,,Red Blend,Antinori
145080,US,"Almost indistinguishable from Beringer's Chabot bottling, perhaps a bit more aromatic and softer in tannins. Flavors range from cassis and black cherry through dark chocolate and dill. Drinkable now with rich foods, but will gain in sweetness and complexity with a few years of cellaring.",St. Helena Home Vineyard,92,80.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
145089,US,"Pretty tannic, a wine that makes the tongue stick to the palate, although it will soften and sweeten up with big, rich roasts. Underlying flavors are of blackberries, currants and tobacco, and the finish is very dry. Seems to have the density and concentration to cellar for the long haul.",Quarry Vineyard,91,80.0,California,Rutherford,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
145096,US,"An extremely tannic and tough wine that numbs the palate despite polished plum, blackberry and dry chocolate flavors. Oak adds vanilla, smoke and a richly creamy texture. Will it age? The compact berry-cherry flavors suggest yes. Try again in 10 years.",Chabot Vineyard,91,80.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
145101,US,"Pretty tannic, and extremely well-oaked. Char, vanilla and smoke dominate the opening aroma, only gradually revealing underlying cassis flavors. In the mouth, the wine is tannic and young, but the solid core of cherry-berry suggests aging until 2008.",State Lane,91,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
145109,US,"Quite as tannic as Beringer's other limited-release single-vineyard Cabs, although a streak of buttery softness makes it drinkable now. Richly marbled with cassis, dark chocolate and cherry flavors, and very dry. Seems to have the depth and structure for the long haul. Try after 2006.",Tre Colline,91,80.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
145114,New Zealand,"The U.S. pricing for this wine is a bit extravagant, but the wine delivers wonderful spicy and savory aromas, backed by loads of cherries, a creamy mouthfeel and hints of vanilla briars and spice. Firm on the finish; try again in 2008. Imported by American Estates Wines, Inc.",Target Gully,90,80.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Mt. Difficulty
145143,France,"This is a great, generous wine, packed with dark fruit and tannins. It comes from a well-drained vineyard on the slopes of the hill of Hermitage. There's dry tannins, but they are overwhelmed by the huge spice, herbal,    and blackberry jelly flavors. It should age well over 10-20 years.",Le Méal,94,80.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Syrah,Ferraton Pere et Fils
145193,US,"There's a good Pinot in here waiting to get out, and three or four years may do it. Young and angular, with ripe cherry fruit and a rich earthiness suggesting sweet pipe tobacco, this well-oaked wine is dry, with an elegant, silky texture.",Rochioli Vineyard Le Pinot,89,80.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Davis Bynum
145382,US,"One of seven limited-production, single-vineyard Cabs this vintage by Beringer, a dense, concentrated mountain wine of considerable strength. The cassis, plum and herb flavors are just beginning to emerge from a tannic sleep, although the wine remains young and quite ageworthy.",Marston Vineyard,91,80.0,California,Napa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
146004,US,"Extraordinarily tough, tannic and dense, a wine that simply cannot be consumed without proper aging. The tannins are outsized by present day standards, and finish dry and rasping. Yet the wine is saved by an underlying integrity. It's a gamble for the long haul.",Bancroft Ranch,89,80.0,California,Howell Mountain,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
146042,France,"Condrieu also comes in a rarer, sweet style, and here it is, in a wine that is both opulent and exotic. This cuvée de prestige is sweet, certainly, but it has layers of dry botrytis which give it balance. There's also acidity to give the wine a final lift.",Ayguets,90,80.0,Rhône Valley,Condrieu,,Viognier,Yves Cuilleron
146776,US,"Opens with a solid Cabernet nose of black currants. The tannins here are fine and dispersed, the acidity is a little low in the current fashion, yielding a plush mouthfeel. Finishes long and spicy, but maybe a touch superficially pretty.",Reserve,90,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,M. Cosentino
146780,US,"They must have let the grapes get as ripe as possible, and then macerated the crushed fruit for a long time, as this wine explodes with berry flavors. There's also a good amount of smoky and spicy oak accents. It's a balanced, harmonious Cabernet.",,90,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Spelletich Cellars
146915,US,"Fine berry fruit, dried flowers, and an olive note mark the intriguing nose of this very dry, even austerely elegant blend. Very mature, almost raisiny fruit and dark-chocolate flavors cover the palate. A full finish with tobacco notes wraps up this very masculine package. Hold until 2005.",Eloge,89,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Conn Valley
146931,US,"Quite black, with an espresso-like streak from start to finish. The plum and earth aromas and flavors are wrapped in a high toast envelope here. So dark it's almost hard to read, and at times it seems a bit heavy; but in the end it is likable, with burnt sugar and crème brûlée on the finish. Drink from 2004 until 2012.",Reserve,88,80.0,California,Stags Leap District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chimney Rock
146975,US,"Dried cherry, cedar-toast and cumin notes mark the nose of this Sangiovese-Cabernet Sauvingon-Merlot blend. It has a decidedly Tuscan cast to its sour-cherry-and-leather profile, and finishes dry, even and long, with hints of chocolate and plenty of toasty oak.",Splendo Blendo 1,89,80.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Red Blend,De Loach
147075,US,"This is certainly the best, ripest of Trefethen's current crop of Cabs, but its built along very different lines from more opulent wines further north along Highway 29. It's surprisingly tough, lean and angular for an '01, loaded with sharp-elbowed tannins, but it does seem to have the fruity stuffing for the cellar. Hold until at least 2008.",Reserve,86,80.0,California,Oak Knoll District,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trefethen
147453,France,"Dominated by wood from start to finish, from scents of vanilla, toast and dried spices, to flavors of cinnamon-dusted toast and a dry, cedary finish. There's enough fruit to support the wood, but not to shine through.",Clos des Fiètres,85,80.0,Burgundy,Corton,,Pinot Noir,Michel Picard
147520,Portugal,"Densely packed aromas of tobacco, mushroom and earth yield ever-so-slowly to barnyard, mint and currant aromas. Even at nine years of age, it's tight and beneefits from some airing in a decanter. Pleasant plum and black-cherry flavors emerge with time, but the real story here is the finish, which is show-stopping: long, multifaceted and intense.",Barca Velha,90,80.0,Douro,,,Red Blend,Casa Ferreirinha
148395,Austria,"Classic, cellar-worthy Riesling, combining a ripe, creamy mouthfeel with great length and precision on the finish. Citrus and apple scents start it off, joined by riper pear flavors and hints of orange and bergamot. Long on the finish, picking up layers of peppery, minerally spice. Drink 2014-2020, or beyond.",Spitzer Singerriedel Smaragd,91,80.0,Wachau,,,Riesling,Franz Hirtzberger
148788,France,"This lovely tete de cuvée shows off a mature, sweet bready nose with light citrus accents. It hits the palate with assertive, full green apple, bright citrus fruit complemented by strong leesy notes. Quite young and lively despite its age, it closes long with complex lemon and yeast flavors, and should even improve with a few more years in the bottle.",Consécration du Siècle Brut,89,80.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Champagne Blend,J. de Telmont
149210,Portugal,"A dense, firm style of wine from this small Dutch-owned Port house. Offers good acidity, old wood and very bitter chocolate flavors. The aftertaste, by contrast, is sweet.",Presidential 30-year old tawny,87,80.0,Port,,,Port,C. da Silva
149243,New Zealand,"Price aside, this is an outstanding effort in need of several years' cellaring. SMoky, meaty aromas open into cherry-berry fruit. Rich and full on the palate, it closes with a long dusty finish. Anticipated maturity: 2003-2015.",EV,92,80.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Merlot-Cabernet Franc,Sileni
149310,New Zealand,"A big, rich, structured wine, with cola and rosemary notes that give nuance to the strong black-cherry aromas and flavors. With its plentiful but ripe tannins, it could use a couple years' of cellaring before being ready for primetime.",Block 5,91,80.0,Central Otago,,,Pinot Noir,Felton Road
149465,New Zealand,"This top New Zealand Syrah starts with lifted, floral peach and apricot notes, followed by a freight train of blackberries. The lush fruit persists on the palate, ending in a slow swell of ripe tannins. A triumph for winemakers-owners Warren Gibson and Lorraine Leheny. Drink now–2015. Imported by Sauvage Selections.",La Collina,91,80.0,Hawke's Bay,,,Syrah,Bilancia
149820,Germany,"Unique and idiosyncratic, this extravagantly priced wine certainly makes a statement. Smoky, mineral and spice scents are layered over tropical fruits that range from mango to lychee. Clean and crisp on the finish, without the same length as Bürklin-Wolf's Deidesheimer Hohenmorgen. Imported by Classical Wines.",Forster Kirchenstück GC Riesling QbA Trocken,88,80.0,Pfalz,,,Riesling,Dr. Bürklin-Wolf
150613,Canada,"Inniskillin continues to push the boundaries of icewine, as evidenced by this wood-aged Vidal. The vanilla and spice of oak barrels partially masks some of the stranger Vidal aromas, allowing the apricot and peach scents to come to the fore. There are some creamy lactic notes on the finish that detract slightly, but this is a very good effort at an entirely different genre.",Oak Aged Ice Wine,89,80.0,Ontario,Niagara Peninsula,,Vidal Blanc,Inniskillin
